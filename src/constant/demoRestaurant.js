                              "The only time I could get local food ! So glad to be able to dine at this unconventional restaurant. It has several levels ( 3 floors at least? Didn’t get to check it out) but the whole design of the restaurant  is just so unique. I didn’t goggle much about this place, it was recommended by a friend . It felt like there was a rich history behind this restaurant.  I’ll list down my favourite food, the crab spring rolls and soft soft crabs ! ( portions are very small so we order a couple more to share for 4 of us) We didn’t order much . there were 2 orders ( fried rice and morning glory) that took very long to come so we ended up cancelling it as we were too full from drinks and the fried food.",

The selection is good and every one should find something he/she likes.\n\nThe staff is helpful with ordering if you get to confused, just ask for the recommendations.\n\nI would absolutely recommend the soft shell crabs and the mushrooms in a curry.\n\nReservation before is highly recommended due to the limited space and the popularity.",

Was really looking forward to it but the food were pretty bland.\n\nPumpkin flower was pretty tasteless. The tofu was crunchy on the outside and soft inside but it doesn’t have much taste. Soft shell crab was okay but nothing special. Pork stew has better taste. Fried rice is also pretty tasteless.\n\nThese meals came to be 1million dong (44usd), major rip off by Vietnamese standard.\n\nOverall it’s a tourist trap, I wouldn’t recommend this place.",

This restaurant offers a delightful dive into traditional Vietnamese cuisine with a menu that, while I can't recall every dish's name, left a lasting impression thanks to its standout offerings.\n\nHighlights of my meal included the uniquely flavorful soursop soup, the beautifully prepared beef wrapped in vegetables, and perfectly cooked eggplant and salad. The club soda and lime provided a refreshing complement to the meal, making it a simple yet perfect beverage choice.\n\nThe decor of Cuc Gach Quan adds significantly to its charm. The restaurant features traditional Vietnamese elements, creating an authentic and inviting atmosphere. The availability of a second floor offers additional dining space that contributes to the overall welcoming environment.\n\nService here is exceptional, with staff who are not only cheerful but also proficient in English, which enhances the dining experience for international visitors.\n\nOverall, Cuc Gach Quan delivers a wonderful culinary experience that beautifully showcases Vietnamese culture, both through its cuisine and its decor. It's an ideal spot for anyone looking to enjoy an authentic taste of Vietnam in a friendly and beautiful setting.",

I especially enjoyed the papaya salad with beef jerky. The sweetness-chewiness-freshness combo was done at perfection. Fair pricing, good WiFi, attentive staff.\n\nCame across this spot rather randomly, not following any guide, and it turned out to be a majorly lovely surprise. So far my favorite spot in Saigon. Will hopefully come back :)",

We expected wonderful flavors to match the high prices. My vietnamese partner was just as surprised as I am. We ordered BBQ squid, pork fried rice, and papaya salad. All of the dishes were 100 to 150k each and should have cost only 60-80k.\n\nMy ginger tea (ginger and hot water) was 50k.\n\nThey had Lipton tea at 80k on the menu.\n\nThis places prices are joke. You can get better food almost anywhere else. The service is also very mediocre. Staff seemed annoyed I asked for sauce.\n\nI think their 5 star reviews must be fake\n\nNo napkins no sauce no water or tea without asking for it.",

The menu is extensive and can be exhausting but it is an honest reflection of the traditional homemade Vietnamese cuisine - anything can be prepared in the home kitchen!\n\nWe recommend ordering their Vietnamese pork and bamboo shoot salad, fried tofu, fried soft-shell crabs, morning glory and the pork stew. They are all absolutely delicious! The service is efficient, and the price is hard to beat - super affordable!\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for a nice dinner in Ho Chi Minh City. Reservation is a must as well.",

They had an obscenely large menu which I always believe causes low food quality, every dish I had was executed well but just missing that flavor, the sea bass in passion fruit was good but needed something to take it over the edge.  Same goes for the fried morning glory salad and the chicken wings in fish sauce",

Portions were small but allow you to have more variety. Will definitely go back again. Last but not least, the pricing is relatively reasonable (compared to Vietnamese food that one pays in Singapore). Definitely worth going!",

The bacon and lemongrass is fantastics. They also have pickled baby eggplants and cabbage.\n\nWhile the objects and decor are nostalgic, the food that we had was prepared mostly in the traditional way, with a premium (still nostalgic) presentation with a generous use of animal fat for flavours.\n\nThe venue opens wider inside, however no lift and not easily accessible for disabled people. Some staircases are rather narrow.\n\nWe had a great time overall and would definitely come back.",

From the decoration choices to the taste of the food really bring that nostalgic feeling of Vietnam back in the 90s. I would say thay the food here is really tasty and authentic.

Service, not bad but not very warm. Very efficient and did all we asked, so no real complaints (including a taxi in the rain) - just no ‘love’.\nDefinitely go. Be experimental - very worth it.",

The tamarind cocktail was the best. The pho one was good but cinnamon-y.\n\nThe service could be improved for a Michelin star. For example, my partner wasn’t in his seat and they brought the food to the table, multiple times. Also, we sat with people ordering a la carte. At other Michelin star restaurants, they usually separate those getting tasting menu and those that don’t.\n\nFYI - You walk through a wet street market to get to the restaurant. This is part of the chef’s story. see photo for more detail.",

I think if you already expecting a certain number of customers, you should prepare counter measures, instead of making people wait for more than 1 hour.\nFor spending almost 1 million dong per person and we didn’t feel full that we went to another store to eat more because we did not want to wait more -> definitely not worth it for us.",

A nice restaurant, but not Michelin star caliber.\n\nThe service was a notch below the food. The pacing of the tasting menu was a disaster, with some courses being presented within seconds of a course being cleared and others having a 30 minute wait between courses.\n\nWater refills weren't offered proactively, we'd have to ask for a new bottle when ours was empty.\n\nThis would be a fine meal at half the cost and if there wasn't a Michelin star.

Despite having a secured reservation via telephone, the hostess couldn't find our reservation and initially noted that the restaurant was full. After some discussion, we were brought to the second level with a bar. It wasn't clear if there was an option to sit at either the bar or the nearby tables. We asked one of the bar staff, who was clearly intoxicated as asked us to \"Just 'fuc*** choose a spot\".",

                              "**A Unique Experience at Anan Saigon, but Some Disappointments**\n\nOur recent visit to Anan Saigon was an experience full of highs and lows, leaving us questioning its Michelin star status. The flavors were undoubtedly creative, and the culinary vision was evident, but several aspects of our evening detracted from what we had hoped would be an exceptional dining experience.\n\nUpon arrival, my wife and children entered the restaurant while I stayed outside briefly to take a photo. To our surprise, they were turned away at the door and told to wait outside until I joined them. We found this rather unwelcoming, especially since they were made to wait for five minutes before we were allowed to enter together. It was a strange start to the evening.\n\nOnce seated, we were left unattended for a while, with no one coming to take our drink or aperitif orders. Eventually, I had to call the waitress over to assist us. This lack of attentiveness was unexpected for a Michelin-starred establishment. Additionally, the restaurant was quite noisy, making it difficult to fully enjoy the ambiance or have a conversation at our table.\n\nDue to the aircon, my son felt cold during the meal, and unfortunately, there were no blankets available. While the staff did lower the air conditioning when we mentioned it, the situation could have been handled better. Furthermore, the seating arrangement in the restaurant has its flaws. There is a beautiful large painting on one of the walls, but placing seats directly underneath it is not ideal. These spots are quite uncomfortable, detracting from the dining experience.\n\nWhile the food was undoubtedly interesting, we felt that the presentation could have been more engaging. We had hoped to be taken on a culinary journey, but instead, we found ourselves referring to a small booklet for detailed explanations of each dish. This detracted from the immersive experience we had anticipated.\n\nIn conclusion, while Anan Saigon offers a glimpse into innovative Vietnamese cuisine, there were several shortcomings that left us feeling a bit disappointed. For a Michelin-starred restaurant, we expected a more seamless and memorable dining experience.",

On the second time we went upstairs so technically it’s not anan, but it’s the same owners and the same kitchen and closes later (there’s a picture of the bar below). Great service, wonderful food. I would say it’s pricy if you compare to Vietnam standards, but the quality is there and you pay for what you get, I mean if you count the number of meals you will have on holidays I think you shouldn’t be budgeting so as to save 2 bucks. Should definitely try it ! Portions are not huge but this means you can try a few more dishes! I think this is Michelin quality in terms of a culinary experience!",

                              "So after hearing that this is one of the top 100 restaurants in Asia, our expectations were pretty high, but unfortunately the food experience was mediocre at best.\n\nWe took the Saigon tasting menu and the vegetarian tasting menu, they were missing one of the veggie dishes but the waitress kindly replaced it with a different dish from the menu.\n\nThe food was really nothing too special. None of the dishes really blew us away. I mean it wasn’t terrible, and some of the dishes were fine, but I ate some better food at the stands in the steers: The crab fried rice was pretty bland, the wagyu beef tasted like a kebab, and in general, really nothing special here, especially from a TOP 100 restaurant.\n\nAnother downside is that they started to close the place while we were still eating, and placed the outside bins near our table. Furthermore it might sound a little picky, but they didn’t wipe our table between dishes so it got pretty messy. Again, something I would expect from a restaurant at “this level”.\n\nI would say the staff was really nice and friendly.\n\nTo summarize, I really can’t understand why this place got so many praises. It is really fancy compared to other restaurants in Vietnam. But still, the food was not exceeding my expectations, and was disappointing. I would suggest to save your money and go eat at a food stall down the street.",

It is a casual dining restaurant at best, which is reflected in their food and service.\nFor starters we had the Shrimp & Pork Taco. which was a little bland.\nThis was followed by the Duck and Banana Blossom Salad, and Grilled Squid. These were quite nice, although I would have preferred the squid to come out hotter, rather than lukewarm.\nAfterwards was the Waygu Bo La Lot which was tasty.\nThe main was the Angus Shaking Beef. The beef was nice and soft, however, the taste was disappointingly ordinary.\nAnd finally, dessert was the Fish Sauce Ice Cream. I had to try this as it was unique. Disappointingly however, when the dessert arrived, the ice cream was melted (see attached photo).\nOverall, the service was efficient but impersonable and the portions were adequate.\nOverall, I'm not sure how this restaurant got a Michelin Star.\nIt's nothing special.

                              "The food is not well served : on 5 ordered dishes, we sent back one because it was cold. Generally, all meals were salty and too oily. They did not provide enough bread with meals requiring. We took dishes à la carte.\nThe order of food serving was weird and does not make any sense. Service can be improved for a 1* restaurant for sure. Beverages ordered was approximative (I had to asked 3 times for my drink). There was no one welcoming you us at the entrance and you have to enter and go deep in the restaurant to have someone welcoming you.\nThe restaurant is really small and crowded this the atmosphere was not incredible neither. The waiting time between dishes was very long and frustrating.\nNot a good experience for us. Disappointing for a so called 1 star Michelin restaurant.",

We opted for the $125 tasting menu, and while the food was excellent and beautifully presented, the service and overall ambiance fell short of justifying the cost. The entire experience lasted 2.5 hours.\nAt 10 pm, they stopped serving drinks even though we still had 5 courses left.\nVery disappointing ‘Michelin star’ restaurant experience.\nWe can now say we've tried it, but we wouldn't recommend it.",

A creative interplay of different tastes throughout, even for the desserts, where there is bold use of savoury flavours in desserts producing unique and surprising tastes. Worth trying but do be prepared for it to be a different experience especially if you have tried many other Michelin rated restaurants.",

We were then led down to the cocktail bar for dinner and had a spectacular meal with some amazing drinks at the bar. The room was beautiful and each dish was a magnificent fusion of traditional Vietnamese to modern cuisine. The fried Mekong elephant fish was probably the highlight, but everything we tried was spectacular so I think you can’t miss with this menu. The Phojito was great but the black tea infused gin cocktail might have been my favorite. The bar keeper was very friendly, helpful and even gave us tips of where else to eat in this vibrant city. Definitely worth a visit when visiting the impressive capital of Vietnam!",

We were given detailed menus with information from the Chef stating why he chose certain flavors and ingredients. The staff also explained each individual dish in detail upon serving it to us. If you love a good experience and food journey, this is definitely a place for you! I could not be more pleased with the service we experienced!! Truly awesome!!!\nThe restaurant requires recommendations but everything you need to know is easy to find with a quick google search. CC is accepted. The tasting menu is plenty of food and we left with full bellies. They do confirm allergies with you before serving to make sure everyone can get enjoy.",

The food was good overall but no overly memorable dishes.\n\nThe atmosphere is only average, many restaurants in HCM have a cooler or more sophisticated setting. You are sat quite close together on cheap looking furniture.\n\nStaff was friendly but again not overly attentive. They also wanted to give us an a la Carte menu when we booked a set. We had to show them our emails as they didn’t believe us, I find it strange we had to really convince them to serve us a set menu.\n\nCocktails were good and food provided a good journey through Vietnam.

                              "Dining at Anăn Saigon is truly an extraordinary experience, and it's no surprise that it’s ranked #48 among Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants and holds the honor of being the first Michelin-starred restaurant in Saigon. I had the Chef's Tasting Menu, \"Homage to a New Vietnam,\" which takes you on a culinary journey from North to South Vietnam.\n\nThe meal began with the Smoked Caviar Egg, featuring a Đà Lạt free-range chicken egg topped with fish sauce caviar and Dalat caviar—a unique and luxurious start. The Foie Gras Spring Roll, a nod to Hà Nội, was rich and perfectly complemented by truffle and herbs.\n\nThe Le Petit Bánh Mì was a standout, with A5 wagyu and pâté served in an airy baguette, capturing the essence of a classic Sài Gòn street food with a refined twist. Another highlight was the Caviar Bánh Nhúng, a street-style waffle tart topped with smoked salmon, crème fraiche, and more Dalat caviar—each bite was a delightful mix of textures and flavors.\n\nThe Canh Chua River Prawn, representing Bến Tre, featured a grilled Mekong river prawn paired with a sweet and sour soup that was both comforting and sophisticated. The Chả Cá Hà Nội, with black cod and bun noodle, was another nod to traditional flavors, executed with precision.\n\nOne of my favorite dishes was the Bún Chả Bourdain, a tribute to Anthony Bourdain, featuring grilled pork and crispy spring roll paired with bún noodles and Pasteur Street Jasmine IPA—a perfect blend of modern and traditional elements.\n\nThe Grilled Pigeon was cooked to perfection, with tender pigeon breast and a flavorful Phú Quốc pepper sauce, served with sticky rice and betel leaf. The meal ended on a sweet note with the Young Coconut & Caviar dessert, a refreshing coconut ice cream topped with Dalat caviar—an exquisite balance of sweet and savory.\n\nAt 3.2M VND++ per person (~130 USD++), the tasting menu offers a memorable culinary adventure that’s worth every penny. The recommended wine pairings were also excellent, with a good selection of both white and red wines to complement the dishes.\n\nAnăn Saigon is a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the heights of Vietnamese cuisine in a luxurious and innovative setting. Highly recommended!",

Service needs improvement and taste is not anything I would write home about... :( just being honest. Details below.\n\nPros:\n-We liked that this was a break from your normal stuffy Michelin-star restaurant in the fact that it it's located in the middle of an open-air market with a relaxed dressed code. On point with the theme of the restaurant and Viet culture. We liked this fact, but important to know if you're expecting something different.\n-Price point- Did the Chef's tasing menu. Very affordable compared to other Michelin restaurants.\n-Communication- prompt. Booked our reservation 3 days in advance by emailing the restaurant.\n\nAreas of Improvement:\n-Food/Drink: Tasty, but not blow away.\n-Service: Staff were very nice, but unfortunately just not up to  Michelin standards and the primary area of improvement. I would say the pace of food coming out was quite slow with food coming out lukewarm. Waitress forgot to bring water, didn't offer  any wine pairings. We were seated on the second floor dining room which was quite crowded. My seat was weirdly up against a pillar such that the seat was not deep enough to lean back or sit comfortably. Bathrooms were clean, but dark and didn't have paper towels or something similar to dry your hands.",

Our dining experience last night was nothing but appalling!\n\nWe arrived early with full anticipation of the gastronomic taste explosions. As soon as we were seated, we were informed that the price for our set menus has been increased. It would be nicer if we were notified as it happened since we are not local and we made our booking a month in advance.\n\nThe restaurant has a noisy and impersonal ambience because the tables are set too close (20 seats in approx 6 square metres). Also, the door to the smoking area has gaps so we could smell cigarette smoke throughout our dinners.\n\nThe food ingredients are of high quality and the look and feel of the gastronomy experience is quite pleasant. Our palates don't appreciate the creamy taste in Vietnamese food so the wow factor is zero! We could not finish the dessert. A terrible assembly of bánh cam and fruit!!!\n\nWe always enjoy dinning in Michelin rated restaurants but not this one. We don't think we will be back!",

Foos wise, some highlights and some dishes were good, 3 dishes were not to my personal taste but this doesn’t mean the food is not good. You can see the team truly put their effort in making great food, picking fresh ingredients, and the chef highlighting the traditional dishes of Vietnam and putting a modern twist to it, this is not another simple Asian fusion place.\n\nThey even did a special Happy Anniversary which was surprising and very sweet of them to remember! It made us feel special!\n\nOnly 2 things the place could improve on. 1. The wooden seats didn’t have a seat cushion. Sitting through 2 and half hours tasting is a bit hard on the backside. 2. The massive frame on one side of the wall. It’s protruding outwards too much that all guests bumped their heads multiple times throughout dinner. We all had a giggle at first but then it became annoying as you can’t lean back. Changing the back cushion of the seats to a thicker one would remove this problem.",

We did not think we were going to be able to get in but we sent them an email and we were able to get in on this Sunday night. If you’re doing the taster menu, you have to tell them which of the two taster menus you’re gonna do. Apparently it changes every four months. We actually chose a smaller menu because we liked the courses better. We thought the first couple courses came a little quickly, but we loved all the courses, some more than others. Our least favorite course was probably the entrée how the food was presented and tasted were incredible. I would like to try the noodle shop my friend did the wine pairing, but it only came with two glasses of wine and I liked my cocktail, but I could’ve had more. I highly recommend coming here and I will be back.",

                              "This Vietnamese restaurant was a mixed experience for me.\n\nThe food was yummy and well presented, especially the chef’s tasting menu with its cool cooking methods showcasing innovative gastronomy techniques. But some dishes like the “Saigon Shaking Beef” and “Banh Cam” felt overly exaggerated.\n\nThe drinks were alright, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service was okay, but not Michelin-star level.\n\nThe place is a bit small and you get nudged by other customers quite a bit.\n\nConsidering its Michelin star and all the hype, I thought it would be better. It’s worth checking out, but I’m not sure I’d go again.\nOverall, it was decent, but not one that left a lasting impression.\n\nP.s: You have to go through a wet market to get there. This is part of the chef's story",

Relatively pricey for Vietnam but for a high quality meal especially a Michelin star one it’s 100% worth it. Memorable meal",

No regards to how my knees might feel from the stairs.\n\nNo one bothered to check in, other than take my order and refill my beer. Chef was making his round but surprisingly skipped me, strange indeed.\n\nFood is great if you just want the food only experience.",

Full of flavour, subtle textures and fresh ingredients, every course added to this amazing culinary experience.\n\nServive went above and beyond. The waitresses were so kind and knowledgeable. They guided us through every course of the menu and provided us with invaluable explanation and comments on how to savour every dish. Their attention was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nWe will definitely visit again.",

Each dish had full of flavor, textures.\nMy favorite were Pho Bo and Le Pot Au Pho, the wagyu beef melted in my mouth, the broth were rich and beautifully clear.\nAnd later Chef Peter offered to serve our dessert at @letsnhaunhau  where we ordered some shot with coconut worm & great cocktails.

Such a beautifully constructed meal in the middle of a market. Service was absolutely charming and efficient but surprisingly with some rough edges which weren’t problematic but things like handing off a bottle of wine for another person to open - English was brilliant but I’d expect the chef to train his staff a bit more - having said that, as I said, the staff were charming and efficient and the meal was extremely memorable. It’s not cheap but worth a splurge.",

While the food is pricier than the usual local stalls, it feels like a 'safer' place to be if you're a foreigner and are a little wary of trying street food. You can get whatever you wanna try at restaurant quality, giving you the best of a taste of Vietnam. More a place for tourist than locals for sure,  but always a good start to the trip until you decide to be more adventurous and go for street food/more local stalls",

The ambiance is inviting, the service staff is attentive, and the local cuisine, while slightly pricier, offers great value for the quality. The menu features a wide variety of options with photos, making it easy to choose even if you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese dishes. The friendly staff are always ready to help explain items.\n\nWe visited during dinner without a reservation and were seated quickly as another group had just left. We decided to order a variety of mains and sides to share, which allowed us to sample many items on the menu.\n\nFrom rolls to wraps, salads, eggplant, tempura, and broken rice, every dish was well-prepared. We even enjoyed the fried banana dessert. The only minor disappointment was that they had run out of beef at the time of our order, leaving us to choose other options.\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable dining experience, and I look forward to returning to try the beef dishes we missed on our recent visit.",

While the food portion is generous, I didn’t think the taste was any better than the other Vietnamese restaurants. The deco is special but that’s about it. We also had to wait for quite some time before we were served, that was after we went to get the menu ourselves too. Been there, done that, probably won’t be back again.",

We cherry picked from both for Happy Hour and were happy with the results.\nStaff are friendly and attentive and the food is tasty. The interior is comfortable with a fun, colourful decor. You can also seat yourself on the patio with the view of the park across the street.",

From their menu, each dish we tried was well-prepared and satisfying.\n\nThe staff and manager were notably friendly, adding a welcoming touch to our visit.\n\nOne minor downside for me was the absence of a bidet sprayer in the restroom 😂 but overall, the restaurant's inviting atmosphere, delicious food, and well-maintained facilities more than compensated for this.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Propaganda for a great experience.",

We really loved this option as we were able to choose to have it as sour or as sweet as we wanted!\nFor starters we ordered some Fresh Rolls with Tempura Prawn and Fresh Rolls with Duck plus the Rice Noodle Salad with Lemongrass Beef in Betel Leaf to share as a main.\nThe dishes were absolutely delicious and the serving sizes were large so we were very glad we were sharing the dishes.\nWe took our time enjoying the food and taking in the funky decor, so much so that we decided to indulge in a couple of their deserts (which we rarely do).\nWe ordered the Sticky Coconut Rice with Fresh Mango and Coconut Cream and the Passionfruit Custard with Fresh Passionfruit Pulp. Again, they were super tasty and the flavours were divine!\nSo with full bellies we headed home for a well earned rest after such a great feast. One that we would totally recommend!\n\nNote: There were a lot of tourists here (which I believe is due to its location) but the food is really great here so don’t let that or that fact that’s it’s super busy put you off!",

We ordered many dishes from spring rolls to mushrooms and dragon beans,  the garlic/ pepper shrimp , chicken and pineapple and ever dish was excellent.\n\nThe food is meant to be shared and in general all came out at once. The portions were also quite larger.\n\nFor the amount of food plus 2 bottles of wine we felt the prices were quite reasonable. There are multiple locations but really like the ambiance of this one.\n\nService was also good. Reservations are recommended as it is popular and busy. Definitely will come back.",

However please do book in advanced, when we arrived we are lucky that we are about to get a seat for 5. Should you want to get other better seats like 2nd or 3rd level do book.\n\nThe menu were clear and it describes the dishes for you to know what you will be having. All items were serve as it was display in the menu. Huge portions fyi and your are warned.\n\nService were OK and good enough for the busy setup. Staff were friendly and were quick in getting your thoughts before proceed with the next items.\n\nRecommended to come if ya want to enjoy and have a nice place to chill.\n😎😎😎",

It had about 10 pairs of spring roll variations and was just about enough carbs for 2 pax.\n\nWe ordered Passionfruit Sauce Deep Fried Sea Bass and it was heavenly and portion was soooo much. The skin of the fish was scaled perfectly and fried to perfect crispiness.\n\nWe had a Sweet and Sour Beef dish which had a disappointing portion of beef and regretted not ordering the Coconut Pork dish.\n\nThey serve beer and some classic cocktails, which were pretty well made by the bar for the price point.\n\nThey have mosquitoes at the balcony so beware, and also where there are long tables couples should try to avoid sitting close by as the tables are noisy.",

Unser Fazit nach unserem 3-wöchigen Aufenthalt in Vietnam: Essen und Speisenauswahl top, Personal motiviert und überdurchschnittlich freundlich, schönes, modernes Ambiente. Authentische vietnamesische Küche bestens interpretiert. Zwar etwas hochpreisiger, aber angemessenes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis. Das Quan Bui, zweifelsohne unser Lieblingslokal in Vietnam.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nWe ate at Quan Bui twice.

A little more expensive, but reasonable value for money. Quan Bui, without a doubt our favorite restaurant in Vietnam.",

                              "We absolutely love this place and have been there twice on our trip to Saigon. It was recommended by a friend who lives here and we couldn’t agree more that it is just wonderful.\nIt has a lovely retro Saigon flair with an urban touch, good lighting, amazing food and an absolutely lovely service team. They walk the extra mile to make you feel welcome and at home, the service is impeccable and comes from the heart and they all speak great English. Our kind waiter Don gave us perfect recommendations and patiently explained how to eat the different dishes (some need to be put into a little wrap and we were very grateful for the demonstration).\nMake a reservation if you can: On the ground floor it’s more family style with long wooden tables, first floor has a cosy balcony and the top floor a small rooftop terrace.\nThe food is authentic, very tasty and good to share.\nWe’ll be back next time - this is truly one of the most charming Saigon food experiences!",

Flavours were distinct to each dish.\n\nEdited - Each time I return, the service seems to be dropping. One particular staff looked so angry and bothered each time I called out for assistance, maybe she had a bad day. Some dishes were forgotten and arrived way too late. Food quality is still great but the service leaves much to be desired. A little smile protocol would go a long way to make a diners experience better.",

                              "Slowest service I’ve ever experienced. Once I was sat down, no one came to get my order. I had to chase down a different waiter. After ordering and waiting 40 minutes I almost came to the conclusion that they were raising the chicken starting from its egg form and waiting for it to mature before preparing it for me. The water spinach came out equally as slow, I asked for it to be boiled and it came out room temperature and soggy. I asked for no drinks because I don’t drink while I eat and the server said “how about Tea”? I reluctantly said fine as most establishments give out free tea. It would have been a good drink after the meal. Turns out this was not the case, the tea was an extra 15k. That’s not expensice, it was just the principle. Catered to mostly unknowing tourists. Avoid alone for the high prices.\n\nTaste was 1.5/5",

The platter was delicious and contains a variety of different things to dry (both fried and steamed) - recommend sharing this 2-3 pax. The morning glory had too many stems in it compared to Bep Me In and they give you soy sauce which personally I don’t think you need. The crab and corn fried rice didn’t have a lot of crab unfortunately and personally I think the fried rice was a bit dry. There are several floors so don’t think you need to worry about wait times (note that we came around 10-11 in the morning). The staff however are lovely and atmosphere is quite nice. However, worth going once (no food was left behind). Note that I think it’s on the pricier end compared to your local eats.",

There is only two dish here but enough to completely fill you up to the brim with fresh goodness!!\n\nThe squid served here is equivalent to a fine dine standard cut of grill + a very tangy sauce to go with it. What was genuinely worth to try again is the beef simmered in vinegar sour soup. It really isn’t as intimidating as it sounds but rice wrapped with a choice of medium well or even fully cooked beef and the usual assortment of vegetables that you can expect from Vietnamese restaurant is such a bomb!!\n\nThey even garnished the soup further with banana flowers, it was such a refreshing experience!",

I would give it a solid 5/5 rating without hesitation.\n\nThe class was not only incredibly fun but also highly interactive. I had the opportunity to meet and connect with wonderful people from diverse backgrounds, truly representing all walks of life. Together, we embarked on a delightful journey to the local market, where we sourced the freshest ingredients for our culinary creations.\n\nUnder the guidance of our skilled instructor, we learned to master the art of cooking basic Vietnamese dishes, including mouthwatering spring rolls and delectable soy chicken cooked in a claypot. The location of the class, near the renowned Ben Tanh Market, added to the overall convenience and charm.\n\nSpeaking of the instructor, they were an absolute star! Their expertise, passion, and ability to teach made the class even more enjoyable. I genuinely appreciated their guidance and patience throughout the session.\n\nOn top of the fantastic cooking experience, I couldn't help but indulge in their delightful coffee. It was simply superb and added an extra touch of pleasure to the overall ambiance.\n\nIn conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend the Hua Tuc Cooking Class. It offers an unforgettable experience, filled with fun, learning, and delicious food. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment and left with a newfound love for Vietnamese cuisine. Don't miss out on this fantastic opportunity - you'll love it too!",

We sat outside on a warm, rainy evening and enjoyed the calm ambiance with green vines away from the hustle and bustle in District 1. Great experience for our first night in HCMC. We had the clams in lemongrass broth, chicken wingettes and crispy pho ap – all three dishes were nicely plated and the flavours were well balanced. The pho ap had the perfect texture from a crispy, chewy first bite to soft interior. We paired the dishes with a couple of cold beers. The service was attentive and the food came out very quickly. Overall, it was exactly what we needed after 30+ hours of traveling from Ottawa, Canada!",

Sumptuous Vietnamese fusion food in a rustic atmosphere. Being a former opium refinery, the restaurant oozes retro ambience. We had 2 appetizers:- steamed clams with lemongrass ginger broth and fresh spring rolls. Clams were splendid tasting.\n\nMains were chargrilled chicken breast, which was a bit dry. The carsmalised pangasius catfish fillet with pork belly was yummy.\n\nAnother must order is the Crispy mini rice pancakes with prawns, pork and crunchy veg.\n\nService is efficient and the staff all speak good English.

                              "We unexpectedly stumbled across this delightful restaurant for lunch. We had been walking around Ho Chi minh city sightcseeing then deciding where to eat.\nWe found this quaint little place tucked away in a side street/Alley/cul-de-sac type street.\nThe food was delicious, staff friendly and attentive and our dining experience was pretty good.\nThe decor here was rather old style but you could see it is being upkept well. The mood was good, busy but organised and possibly at the time we dined, there were business people having lunch too. Its possibly a place for locals to have business lunches, however we noticed other tourists too.\nIt was a great find.",

You know the fried Lobster rolls are the right order choice when every table around you is getting one!\nWe love the fried dragon beans, and the mango salad. Try the caramelised grouper fish if you like seafood.\nBe sure to make reservation via their online website in advance as it can be full during dinner hours.",

The food was of the highest quality with beautiful flavours. My favourites were the crab salad, netted spring rolls and the prawn curry. My husband loved the chicken and mushroom soup. Slightly disappointed with the dessert as it wasn't really to our taste, however it was nice to try something new. Well worth the price for the experience.",

The experience certainly lived up to our expectations and beyond with the cost being the same as our local average restaurant in Aus. Beware of the French wine. Hubby ordered after quite a few drinks. Although delicious it will increase the bill significantly $220 Aus😆 The food, service and ambiance was amazing. I can not praise it enough. It is a must visit for food lovers . Fine dining at its best.",

The finishings and small details are stunning. The service was also immaculate, and it definitely lived up to expectations as a fine dining restaurant.\n\nIn terms of the food, while it was great, both of us were underwhelmed by the flavours. I ordered the soft shell crab with mango salad, and it just felt like it was missing a sauce or flavour that made it 'zing'. The crab was over battered, and there was nothing to cut through the grease. I just thought it was a bit bland. My partner got lemongrass pork, and I think they may have forgotten to include the lemon grass altogether.\n\nI would still recommend a visit if you are looking for a beautiful dining experience in Vietnam. Perhaps we just got the chef on an off day as the other reviews paint a delicious picture of the food that we didn't experience.",

Restaurant is very nice looking, service is fanstastic, menu is fancy, prices as well, but unfortunately the food was not so great. It was average at most.

Of course Saigon is renowned for its amazing street food culture, But sometimes we do need a place for proper dinner to host our business partners, or just to have a good quality vietnamese meal with our beloved ones and this must be the place.",

                              "This was a frustrating experience. The room is lovely and the service is professional and friendly but the food left me wondering….why?\n\nI’ll start with the Pho, you would expect this dish to be amazing, it should be amazing, but it was bland, bland, bland and very disappointing.\n\nWe went heavy on the starters and got the same dipping sauce and garnish on most dishes, I know there are many sauces to have in Vietnam therefore I would have expected to experience some of these.\n\nThe pork ribs as a main dish were amazing!\n\nLet’s talk about “value add” experiences and how much the customer enjoys them. A small amuse bouche prior to receiving your ordered items is a must along with a small sweet at the end, not a dessert, just a small one bite taste. This venue would benefit from this sort of service. A restaurant that is placing itself in the upper end of the market should be offering this sort of service.\n\nGo and check it out, the food is good, but it doesn’t quite hit the spot that you might expect.",

The decor is amazing, I felt like I was in the 20s. Staff always there at attention, great English. Highly recommend you try it and then go shopping at the silk stores on the same street to walk it off ;). And, 18 months later I’m back for the at least 6th time and was wowed by the service of Trieu.",

                              "buyer beware: there is a SANDALS TAX upon entry. walking inside feels like the villages found vietnam and the food is exactly what you might expect in a retirement community. having a dress code when the food does not measure up is just a nod to stuffy pretension. michelin guide is not a star exactly because there is nothing remarkable about the dishes. it’s not bad it’s just fine. in this amazing city of food, just fine vietnamese food is a travesty at this price point.\n\nservice is acceptable and honestly feel badly that they need to compensate for the subpar food experience.\n\nthis is the kind of place you take westerners who are afraid of flavor and want the pretend atmosphere of fine dining.\n\nstuff ordered: pork spring rolls, salmon rice rolls, seafood soup, “bo lúc lắc” approximation, grilled pork, and a side of dragon beans. dragon beans were the best part because the greens were interesting. soup was second best because it actually had some flavor (sour and sweet).\n\nand the cocktail “saigon in feminine” was actually horrible. as soon as i saw the blue concoction i knew it would be scary.",

                              "Vietnam House, owned by the celebrated Chef Luke Nguyen, is more than just a restaurant; it's a culinary voyage through Vietnam. Housed in a beautiful French Colonial building, the ambience is elegant with a touch of modern sophistication.\n\nThe menu, meticulously crafted by Chef Nguyen, boasts a delightful array of traditional Vietnamese dishes with a modern twist.  Expect to find all the classics you love, like phở and bánh mì, alongside innovative creations that burst with fresh, local flavors.  I was particularly impressed by Rice Noodles with Grilled Iberico Pork & Lobster Netted Spring Rolls.\n\nNo Vietnamese dining experience is complete without refreshing cocktails and decadent desserts. Vietnam House delivers on both fronts. Their beverage list features innovative takes on classic cocktails, incorporating unique Vietnamese ingredients.  And don't forget to save room for dessert - their options are as delicious as they are beautiful.\n\nWhile the price point leans towards fine dining, the quality of the ingredients, the expertise of the chef, and the overall ambiance make Vietnam House a worthwhile splurge.  The attentive service adds another layer of refinement to the experience and the cocktails were delicious. We only wish we'd had a chance to meet him!",

Deposit is needed.\n\nThe food was incredible, we loved every course.\nI think a 4 star is what I wanted to rate, considering the value for money. However, the reason I rated a 3 star was because of the service.\n\nIn the beginning everything was great, but after finishing the main course we waited for at least 20 minutes for nothing. It was cheese time but no one informed us until another table was asked to choose the cheese.\nThen for the dessert we also waited for a long time. Waiting for the bill was the worst, I really don’t understand what took them 10 minutes for getting bill.\nThe long wait did reduce the satisfaction.\n\nIn the end the chef came out to talk to every table which was good!",

                              "Ventured into La Villa French Restaurant for a dinner meeting and was thoroughly impressed by their exclusive seasonal tasting menu. This gem of a venue, beautifully housed in a lovingly preserved bungalow, marries elegance with the heartwarming pieces of France. With its warm atmosphere, it’s been a cornerstone for fine dining enthusiasts for over 11 years, championed by the remarkable Chef Thierry Mounon.\n\nThe selection of our meal was a grand saga of flavors, cherishing the full charter of the season’s productions. It was an avant-garde enactment of French cuisine ingenuities, served with skill and purity that both excites and comforts the heart. True to Chef Mounon’s reputation, the accompaniment for the night—dishes architected with humility, preparing the materials with integrity, nuanced flavorings, and earned room for the creative road—reflected the prudence of orchestrating grown love in savories and confectionaries.\n\nBehind the casements of service, we saw crafted decorums of kindness, amplified by course narrations that honoured the season and their cherished geographies. A medley of unparalleled knowledge, amorous overfeed, and meet making what’s traditional into discontinuities for curious juveniles and seasoned groups alike.\n\nLa Villa French Restaurant is a starlit vessel that cruises the boundless turfs of the culinary arts, reaffirming that the essence of French cooking lies not just in its taste but in its experience. Here, you’re not just dining; you’re regaled with evidences why there is heroism in the core of quixotic plates, as each dish succors story, euphoria, and beginnings anew. Peeling back the social grace to my next visit, and saluting the odes that shall be.",

The wine is not included, if you want the recommended wine for each dishes you need to pay an extra but it worth it.\nThe wasabi cream was for me the masterpiece of the whole course.\nThe cheese selection is great but adapted to the asian taste.

                              "Based on my personal experience, I cannot strongly recommend this restaurant. Although I had initially secured an indoor table through the online booking system, the manager, Tina, persuaded me to switch to outdoor seating in the late afternoon with some excuse. Unfortunately, this is where the experience took a turn for the worse.\nDO NOT RISK YOURSELF AND SIT OUTDOOR!\nThe outdoor atmosphere was appealing but my enjoyable meal was unfortunately interrupted by unpleasant second hand smoke in the middle of the main course. For non-smokers, the indoor seating will be a safer choice.\nLet us go back to food. Overall, the food ranged from good to great. Lacking some mind blowing factor to make me wow. The amuse bouches were either good or normal. The prawn ravioli was excellent/great with its sauce. The Hokkaido scallop tasted fantastic/great with top-notch quality. The tenderloin was a bit disappointing and still good: the foie gras had a superb texture but a slightly fishy aroma, while the tenderloin itself met expectations. The cheese was average, with nothing particularly noteworthy. However, the apple tartare was exceptional: crispy and aromatic.\nThe service was initially attentive, but it became inconsistent as the restaurant filled with more guests. Unfortunately, the wait for my cheese after the tenderloin was unacceptable. Despite requesting it twice, I waited over 35 minutes, which falls short of the standards expected for a fine dining establishment.\nMy ratings tells everything and hope it helps.",

                              "Excellent experience at Laang today! The service was fast, attentive and friendly. The food quality was exceptional. We ordered the bun bo hue which had high quality beef, but a more mild taste in comparison to other local restaurants. We also ordered the mango salad with sea bass which was by far the star of the meal. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and the mango salad was juicy and flavorful. It also came with prawn crackers that complimented the juicyness of the salad well. For the other main, we ordered the banh mi \"dep chay\" which is a vegetarian mushroom sandwich. It was well cooked and had an amazing sauce on it. The bread was high quality baguette as well. The only thing I didn't like we're the french fries. I felt they were bland and lacked crispiness and seasoning. Finally we ordered the \"bo la lot chien\" which is beef wrapped in betel leaf then fried. It was tasty but different from what I was expecting having had bo la lot as street food before. All in all if you're looking for high quality, modern Vietnamese cuisine in a relaxed setting, come to Laang. You won't be disappointed. Also it is pet friendly, so you can bring your dog!",

The server was able to answer all my questions about the menu in detail, including the grams of meat used to make a dish. They were quick and efficient and the food was flavourful. The risotto was cheesy and comforting and the carrots were the best I’ve had - caramelized to perfection. I enjoyed the salmon taco in the crispy nori shell. The dishes were creative and had many complementary elements in terms of flavour and texture. They were well thought out. The environment is a little casual since it’s a big open space with the dining room and kitchen visible to each other. It was a bit loud but you could still carry on a conversation. I will definitely be returning.",

Tasty and fresh ingredients. Vivid taste and well executed. Flavors are playful and balanced.\n\nWe enjoyed most dishes. We thought the sauce in duck breast and butter lettuce are too overwhelming / not complementary. The mushroom and egg dish was a bit underwhelming comparing to the other appetizers.",

                              "My dining experience at Quince Saigon was nothing short of spectacular and this is my second time here. The restaurant's commitment to quality service, excellent food, and an inviting atmosphere is evidently clear from the moment you step through the door.\n\nThe staff at Quince Saigon genuinely exemplify the term 'friendly service'. From the minute you walk in, you're greeted with warm smiles and an eagerness to ensure your dining experience is nothing short of perfect. They are attentive without being intrusive, providing recommendations when asked and always ensuring glasses were filled and needs met promptly.\n\nStepping into the world of Quince Saigon's menu is like embarking on a culinary adventure. Every dish is beautifully presented, and the flavors are outstanding. However, the star of the show has to be their steak. The quality of the meat is top-notch, cooked to perfection, and so tender that it nearly melts in your mouth. The steak's rich, full-bodied flavor profile is a testament to the chef's expertise and the restaurant's dedication to sourcing the best ingredients.\n\nJust as impressive as the food and service is Quince Saigon's interior design. The restaurant seamlessly blends the charm of Saigon with a touch of modern elegance. The decor is tastefully done, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that complements the dining experience. It is an environment that invites conversation and lingering over your meal, making the experience feel luxuriously leisurely.\n\nQuince Saigon is a fine dining gem that successfully marries friendly service, exceptional food, particularly the steak, and a delightful interior design to create an unforgettable dining experience. Whether you are a Saigon local or a tourist exploring the city, a meal at Quince Saigon is a culinary journey you won't want to miss.",

The presentation of dishes is beautiful, and they taste quite good, though some dishes could have a more pronounced flavor. Choosing dishes was a bit challenging without pictures in the menu, but you can ask the waiter to show photos from their phone.",

I last went there for a special Iron Chefs battle night. It was truly incredible and fun. Obviously, this is far from the cheapest place but if this is within your reach, it is money well spent, One of the very best restaurants in Saigon. Highly recommended.",

                              "It was a set menu event with 2 time slots, 5:30 and 8pm. We selected the 8pm one,  but had to wait and brought to our table at 8:50 (that table was empty since 8:25, and for some reason we were not sat down).  The whole point of a reservation is for the restaurant to HOLD the table for you.  Someone should learn the definition again.\n\nI have been there 2 times.  The first time was actually good.  This time is a collaboration with a Thai restaurant I think.  The foods was not worth the price. We have had better Thai food for less.  The ingredients used were very good,  but most things that came with the sauce was very salty. Did someone test taste the foods before they were served?  The slipper lobster was okay,  but the Wagyu beef was not edible, too salty.\n\nThe dessert was a weird idea. Fried shallot on top of a cake??? Maybe you wanted to do dried coconut flakes?\n\nOverall, an extremely disappointing experience this time, from the service to the food.  Quince is a high end restaurant,  but just any random small street food stall. I hope they can do better next time.",

From the complementary Bánh xèo taco amuse-bouche to the main dishes to the desserts, all are well-crafted, attention to the tiny details. Especially, we love the duck jus served with the Aged Barbary Duck Breast.\nService is great too! During the booking, they asked about the food allergies and when we arrived, they purposely printed out a different set of menu without beef options.\nA little feedback is about the lighting, they were dark like I hardly could read the menu, probably can make it a bit brighter. :)",

                              "Our inaugural dinner at Quince in Ho Chi Minh City was a delightful experience. The menu boasted an array of dishes, each presenting a unique and flavorful journey, full of 'wow' moments. The scallop pasta, at first glance, appeared ordinary but transformed into an exquisite taste sensation from the first spoonful. Similarly, the Hokkaido tomato dish delivered an unexpected and memorable burst of flavor. A standout was the duck, masterfully cooked over firewood, harmoniously blending the essences of traditional duck and roast pork.Dessert was an innovative take on the classic affogato – encased in a crispy, fried crust, the ice cream lay atop a decadent chocolate coffee sauce, a must-try for aficionados of coffee and chocolate. The meal concluded with a thoughtful gesture: a complimentary box of assorted, subtly sweet candies, handcrafted by the chef, showcasing their culinary artistry.Quince, with its impeccable flavors and service, truly warrants its accolades, including the Michelin guide award. A must-visit for anyone looking for an extraordinary dining experience in Ho Chi Minh City.",

The Hokkaido Scallops and Spicy Salmon and Nori Tacos as starters had amazing flavor, texture and presentation. The roasted cauliflower, carrot and potato dishes were surprising standouts, rich and super satisfying, along side our mains - duck, lamb, sole snd iberico pork. The ridiculously tart yet creamy and cooling mango-passion fruit sorbet made us gasp.  Many thanks for such a memorable meal and birthday experience.",

The staff are correctly trained to be there at a far to easily wave over if you need something, but not standing so close they breathe down your neck like other Saigon restaurants. Our food was outstanding, and when I asked for some accompanying bread to our steak that was already on the table, the waiter brought the bread to our table within 1 minute. I highly recommend this place for those who are looking for a stress free dinner where you can kick back and enjoy yourself without the worry of disappointment in service or food quality.\nWe will be coming back soon!",

When we finished the meal and asked for comments on the dishes, I mentioned to her that the chef did not properly handle the heat of the steak, the surface was a little bitter, but the meat quality was very good and tender, and every other dish was excellent, especially the spicy salmon \"nori taco\". I thought it was just a routine inquiry for customers' feedback. I can't believe she saved us the steak at the checkout!! That's incredible! We think the quality of meat is good, but others asked by the way to give a little advice, did not expect direct free single! I really want to praise the service of this restaurant again. My opinion is not just listening to it, it is really valued. I will come to Ho Chi Minh again next time.",

No particular dish I ordered wowed me. It was good, but not great. I wouldn’t say I had a dish that was so delicious that I’d go back and order it again and no other item on the menu was really calling to me so I probably wouldn’t return even if I was back in town.\n\nI ordered some bread and one slice was slightly burned which was conveniently placed on the bottom of all slices, so quality control was a little lax here.\n\nI felt the steak was under-seasoned but that could also be a preference. It was served with some mustard that was slightly sweet that I just passed on. I asked for some salt and then the beef was good.\n\nThe cauliflower (second photo) was like half cream sauce.. so that was super overwhelming and not a good balance for the dish.\n\nThe asparagus and carrots were good. The best thing about them were the sauces that they were served with.\n\nAll in all, an average but unfortunately unmemorable meal.",

The overall ambiance of the place is high class, and the culinary experience is truly remarkable. The chef's creativity in crafting delicious dishes is evident in every bite.\n\nNot only is the food delectable, but their cocktails are also top-notch. Whether you're looking for an intimate couple dinner or planning a group party, the vibe at Quince is perfect for both occasions. Additionally, the staff members are fluent in English, which adds an extra level of convenience and comfort to the dining experience.\n\nNow, it's worth noting that the prices at Quince  Place are on the higher side. However, I can confidently say that every dollar spent is more than worth it. With a combination of exquisite flavors, excellent service, and a charming atmosphere, restaurant is definitely a must-visit destination in Saigon.",

They are separated orders, but we just tried, it goes very well with the bread, especially their breads are handmade, really fresh!\n\nAnd the picture 3, the duck liver, omg, amazing! Soft, creamy!\n\nwe also had the duck breast, the source and the veggies weren’t that good, but the duck breast, crispy outside, middle fat part immediately melted in my mouth, and the meat cooked to medium, really fresh!\n\nHighly recommend this place.",

                              "Overall mediocre fine dining. We had to be seated upstairs at the sister restaurant/bar because the main dining room was too busy. The upstairs area was absolutely gorgeous with immaculate vibes and music. Very romantic. The food was pricey and overall lacking in flavor in my opinion. Although there was nice presentation and the steak, duck breast, and scallops were cooked perfectly, I think the balance of flavors was off. Needed more of a kick and unique flavors. Overall I felt like it was very mundane. For vibes and good drinks I would recommend, for fine dining, meh.",

Chef Julien and the platoon of sous chefs were well orchestrated into their unique tasks with the most minute attention to every detail! We had the Froi Gras with Sourdough bread, the duck breast and the Affogato. Each dish was a piece of artwork and each bite was an explosion of contrasting flavors, all delightful. A very high end place, but worth it. Great wine recommendation to compliment our dinner. Also, after dinner drink upstairs in the speak easy like bar area. The staff and bar tenders were attentive and not overbearing!!",

We considered this a lucky break as it was great to watch this well oiled machine in action as we tucked in to great food. We had the salad and bread cooked over coals to start, the octopus and lamb for mains and sorbets and ice cream for dessert. The food and service were close  to Michelin star restaurants back home in UK. I felt the lamb dish cooked medium rare was of the highest quality and the sauces and accompaniments matched very well. I’d wanted to try miso ice cream for a while and wasn’t disappointed as this was a flavour packed punch. It was great that we both had 2 scoops of different flavours and the came in separate bowls.\nA great night to be recommended.",

                              "The place definitely is one of the best vegetarian places I have had in a very long time. The flavours and the textures were matched so brilliantly that it gave the experience a lift. We went over during lunch and were immediately greeted with the staff and escorted to our table. Quickly enough, we were brought the menu, which had so many options and variations. The ambience of the pace was peaceful and quiet, which further uplifted the experience. The flavours were really good and well thought through. The various rice options were the highlight, along with the wide spread of various drinks they had to offer. All in all, driveline a place worth visiting if you are in the neighbourhood and don't mind spending a few extra dong to get some high-quality local vegetarian food.",

I came alone a few hours upon landing from the US and could not have asked for a warmer or more perfect welcome. The food was beyond fantastic. Authentic, nutrient dense and creative vegetarian Vietnamese dishes. The menu has descriptions of the health benefits of each meal which is fun to learn. Seeing that I was alone, waitresses chatted with me the entire time, making me feel at home. And if the experience wasn’t already perfect enough, they escorted me to my ride to make sure I got back to the hotel safely. If I could give this place 100 stars I would!",

Sweet, sour tastes combined with the gentle savory flavor of many types of mushroom and veggies just makes it unique but too yummy to forget.\n\nSpacious but quiet restaurant where you can choose any seats to enjoy every corner. The combination of harmonious music sounds, natural wooden furniture and cool green trees will bring us the moments of peace and simple joy.",

From the moment you step enter you feel like you're in for something special. The restaurant has multiple dining levels with each room offering its own unique ambience. We were seated on the higher dining level and the cool evening breeze brought me back to when I fell in love with Vietnam.\nFor me, coming to a higher end vegetarian restaurant the food must satisfy a number of senses, particularly sight and taste. I've eaten at some wonderful fine dining vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam and the visual aspect of the meals have always left me with a wow factor that's never been replicated anywhere else I've ever dined.\nUnfortunately Hum really dropped the ball.\nFor this expensive experience I really expected more, I really expected something that I'd really want to photograph and say to my friends, wow look at this.\nI was left indifferent to the foods taste and it's presentation, however most items I wanted to try were already sold out, so I'm sure there would have been a few gems tucked away there.\nThe overall, I'm unsure i'd like to try it again. I'm just not willing to risk it, particularly when there's so many amazing fine dining vegetarian options available in this wonderful city.",

It's a place that you could easily spend hours in. Had I not needed to check into my hotel, I would've stayed longer.

                              "I stumbled upon this restaurant after visiting the War Remnants Museum, and it was absolutely delightful! I’m not fully veg, but prefer vegetarian food and the food here was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe menu is expansive and they clearly put a lot of thought and time into the dishes (including presentation). The food is on the more expensive side, but not unreasonable if you’re a tourist from the US or Europe. You are paying for the ambiance and service at Hum, along with the food. The staff did also ask me about any allergies or dietary restrictions before taking my order.\n\nI ordered the pumpkin noodles as an appetizer, the spicy tofu curry (wasn’t very spicy, but loved every bite), the brown rice, and the kumquat tea. Total with tax and pre-added gratuity (5%) was about $30 USD.\n\nI would definitely return, if I’m ever in Saigon again. This is a great lunch spot for Hindus/Indians who are veg.",

However, one accustomed to the blistering fast speed at which dishes are pumped out at most restaurants around may be in for a little disappointment. In short, it may take a little longer than expected for the food to arrive.\n\nIn any case, I thoroughly enjoyed the deep fried square spring rolls. The pineapple fried rice was so-so. Longan with lotus seeds dessert was a delight.\n\nAs many have noted, the price to value ratio can be challenged by other choices, but in my opinion it was a unique experience worthy of sampling at least once.",

We would definitely recommend going in for lunch or dinner though. There is a huge and very creative vegetarian menu and in our two visits tried as much as possible! Everything we tried was very good, especially the mushroom “stew” in a coconut, this was incredible. The passionfruit Hotpot was also very very good and had a great combination of flavors.

The service is detailed, yet laid back. Every table is greeted by a guest relations manager to make certain the service and food is up to satisfactory standards and to make small talk. The entire space is welcoming, clean and a nice break away from the bustle of the city. I would recommend this restaurant for romantic dinners, small gatherings of 6 or less people, tourists, health conscious persons and for people that like a little refinement that isn’t pretentious or stuffy.\n\nThe restaurant has had a successful run in its 11 year history and has recently expanded the concept to include a brand new neighboring space that is absolutely stunning! I feel it is worth a visit just to see the building. On the ground floor there is a gift shop which offers many tasteful gifts, specialty Vietnamese wines (passion fruit & apricot wines) and a broad range of artisan products.\nDo yourself a favor and come dine here… even if you are a meat eater.",

For dishes, we ordered crystal salad, spicy bean salad, steamed mushrooms in a coconut, pineapple fried rice and vegetables in a squash. The drinks were both very freaking and delicious. The steamed mushrooms and spicy bean salad were our favorite. They were both flavorful and every ingredient was well-combined together. The pineapple rice was a bit disappointing. It was a bit dry and not much flavorful. The vegetable squash bowl was not bad but also nothing special. There was nothing remarkable about it. The crystal salad was interesting. We never tried fresh aloe vera before. I personally didn’t like the texture of it so much. It was slightly slimy. It's fun to try it though.\n\nThere were lots of creative dishes. On the ground floor it's a shop selling healthy products. The restaurant is at the second and third floor. The facade of the whole building was eye catching. Overall it was a nice experience to try some creative vegetarian dishes.",

                              "(Translated by Google) It's been a long time since I've felt so excited about a restaurant, perhaps partly because I'm so excited to taste the dishes brought by Uncle Thanh Hoa. It's not a waste of time to wait and look forward to it. I'm really satisfied with everything the restaurant has to offer. The value lies not only in the skillfully prepared dishes but also in the very unique menu that is hard to find anywhere else. This not only shows the difference of the restaurant and the chef, but also shows passion and understanding of cuisine.\n\n(Original)\nLâu lắm rồi mới tìm lại được cảm giác hứng thú đến thế với một nhà hàng, có lẽ phần vì rất háo hức được nếm thử những món ăn do chú Thanh Hòa mang đến. Không uổng công chờ đợi và mong chờ, thực sự rất hài lòng ở tất cả mọi điểm mà nhà hàng đem lại. Giá trị không chỉ nằm ở món ăn được chế biến khéo léo mà còn nằm ở menu rất độc đáo khó lòng tìm thấy ở nơi nào khác. Điều này không chỉ thể hiện sự khác biệt của nhà hàng, của bếp trưởng mà còn thể hiện được niềm đam mê và am hiểu với ẩm thực.",

The hot tea we order came out lukewarm. The toilet is just okay. I wouldn't use the hand towel that looks like it's been brought up from the gutter.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the meal \"Mien Xao Ca\" came out so late.\n\nI wouldn't come back here again.

                              "From back alley to bustling rooftop restaurant, this place is a hidden gem within Ho Chi Minh City.\nWe arrived around 7:45pm and had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. The woman at the front doors is illusive, so you need to track her down to get your name put on the waiting list. Make sure you get your name on the list, or else you'll be a sitting duck.\n\nThe food is served in smaller portions, and the style seems to be more shareable, appetizer-sized plates. We ordered at least 12 dishes between 4 people and 4 alcoholic drinks. The total bill came out to 2 million, Drinks were last to come out, and the bar service is slow. The food was tasty and well plated. I recommend trying the soft tofu topped with shrimp and the sticky rice topped with pork. Both are very delicious dishes.\n\nThe kitchen closes at 9:30 pm, and the restaurant seems to shut down for business at 10pm. The ambiance throughout the restaurant is nice, and it was comforting to see it so busy, then you know the food is going to be tasty.",

The food here is top notch and has great prices. Not super cheap street food but cheap, high quality dishes from home cooked meals to 5 different spring roll selection plates.

At night they will open their root top.\n\nYou can order 1 bowl of rice and share it with others. The chicken and fish is a must order. Even the spring rolls is also not to be missed",

Much better you have reservation first so you can choose your table but they also accept walking in. The food is OK for us, we love the beef and fish but we didn't like the squid soup.

This is a casual and comfortable restaurant where you can enjoy South Vietnamese cuisine. My favorite minced lemongrass wraps have a nice scent and are the best. All go well with beer. The prices were about double what they were four years ago, which made me feel sad that prices in Vietnam were also rising. Well, it's still reasonable.

The food was delicious, we have ordered many traditional meals but I recommend you to try the corn salad with dry shrimps it yummy 😋 also mango salad with chicken, coming with many dipping sauces if you like spicy or medium spicy, desserts very a bit too liquid for me personally but please go ahead and try you might like it. Attaching pictures for reference. Ooow and don’t forget the Vietnam is a tropical country so don’t get scared of the lizards 🦎 since they are very cute, small and harmless. Enjoy",

Obviously prices here tend to be a little higher since it's catered for a mostly tourist clientele, but that doesn't detract from the fact Secret Garden does serve pretty decent \"home cooked\" Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nWe ordered 3 dishes.. for 2pax. An appetiser that came w crackers and fried claims. Yummy.\n\nPumpkin fish stew of sorts... It was a bit sweet, probably due to the seasoning and the pumpkin itself. But nonetheless, a hearty dish, although the portion of fish could be more generous.\n\nThe third dish was a lemongrass soup with shellfish /snail with stuffed minced pork and snail.. Sounds exortic but it's really delicious! ❤️\n\nThis restaurant probably has better ambience at night but we were near the area in the day, so we didn't get t to enjoy the romantic ambience. Still, with a retractable roof, you get shelter from the sun when you come here in the afternoon.\n\nAll in all, it was a good experience to dine here and we had a good lunch.",

The food was extremely delicious!\nThe climb up 4 staircases was definitely worth it for the  ambiance that awaits at the roof top . Though I had my concerns when I first saw the entrance and the dodge vibe it gave off. However, this is must visit restaurant in Hochi Minh city . Would completely recommend this experience.",

                              "What a beautiful way to dine!\nLike so many restaurants in Vietnam we headed down an alleyway and then up the stairs until we reached the very top!\nOur reward for the stair climb was a restaurant decorated with fairy lights and silk lanterns, creating a magical dining experience for us.\nIt was packed when we arrived and without a reservation we happily waited for a table to free up - luckily this did not take long.\nWe ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls with Shrimp and Pork and the Banh Xeo or Vietnamese Rice Pancake with Pork and it was not long before the food arrived. The Spring Rolls were delicious but (after looking forward to having Banh Xeo again) I would have to say that the Pancake was my favourite.\nThe service here is fast but also attentive and we were not pressured (even once) to leave after we’d finished our meals, even though the restaurant was full.\nWe would recommend going at night though, as we had read in advance that it gets hot during the day.\nWithout a doubt we would visit again!",

Ah wait, only disappointment I had here is that they ran out of Tonkin flowers this time and we had to get kang kong instead. Really recommend you try the Tonkin flower dish when you are here. Do note it's not wheelchair or elderly friendly in the sense it's is six floors up without lifts. But once you ascend to this secret venue, the food is definitely worth it! Try their various rolls and meats. Service here is also very quick.\nMeal for family of 5 here with drinks cost us around $80. highly recommend!",

Fried spring rolls were not crispy, unsure how you can serve a deep fried dish that doesn’t come out crispy… Beef and Tonkin flower was the only dish that was nice. Service was not great, the decor and atmosphere was nice but overall very disappointed and way overpriced for the quality of food, I wouldn’t waste your time or money here, I had a Bahn Mi earlier in the day for 25,000 VND which was more tasty than 3 of the 4 dishes we ordered.",

Walked up 4 flights of stairs and were pleasantly surprised with the ambience and deco. We were seated promptly as we were early and ordered their speciality dishes - special veggie with sliced beef, banh xeo, platter of chicken with mixed flavours, and char siu fried noodles. All of the dishes were very tasty and generous. The special veggie was unique and tasty. The restaurant gets very busy and at 8 pm, it was full house on a week day. Recommend making a reservation to avoid disappointment.",

The toppings were generous, and overall the food and drink tasted great!\n\nThe place is located in an older building, and can be a little intimidating to new travelers, like myself.\n\nIn conclusion, it was a positive experience. 😋",

Checked with us twice that all was good and offered more rice and dressing.  One bowl was plenty. Was a little difficult to find. Through scooter garage,  up two flights of stairs while wondering if we were headed in the right direction.   Well worth the climb",

                              'I really dont understand why this shop is really over-rated.\n\nI visited there 5pm, no customers but 3 staff no greetings. I asked any other menu but only big board is menu they have and its hard to see it. Another customer stepped in asking any menu but staff answered the same. They only have shop point of view and lack of customer point of view.\n\nI asked how many topping can i have? staff said as much as i want. I like seaweed so i asked extra seaweed but she said no its not in their system. Look at my photo. How small portion of seaweed i got and seaweed dont cost much. Of course, this place is very much top down style of service from the beginning to the end. No greetings, no smiles at all, no flexibility, no generosity. I already ordered fresh fruit juice but they have no water to serve and its only in bottle (chargeable)\n\nI had some poke bowls in Japan, Thailand, Singapore, US, and this is first time in Vietnam. Its quite averaged tastes. By what these Western people put so high review here?\n\nAt the end, after I already finished my meal, one of waitress came to my table asking me "do you want any more rice or sauce?" I was like what?! you guys never told me that I can have additional rice or sauce after. If so, I leave some topping!!! They dont even explain their system... lazy and no hospitality mind at all, no smile. They have their point of view but no customer point of view. Its so silly she asked me to like review, hahahaha, you guys no smiles, so lazy, even not enough cash to give me change proper way (given tonnes of 1k notes!), how you can ask review...\n\nSmall portion of poke and fruit juice cost 260,000 and even no water is served. Hey, go to Pizza 4P at 5pm. 4P serves you infused water or chilled filtered water for free, with 260,000, you can be full and happy face, service better, better tastes, better hospitality at 4P pizza. At 5pm at 4P, you can get 2 alcohol buy 1 get 1, and 1 Margherita, 1 ice cream, full and happy just cost around VND 250,000. I will never come back to Poke Saigon.',

One small plate containing the bo la lot, and another huge plate containing the herbs, bún, rice paper, pickled cucumbers, pickled shredded carrots & radish, and some sort of kimchi.\n\nSince this is my first bo la lot, I don’t really have any comparison. The meat rolls tasted good. All the herbs are fresh. Beware, one of the herbs is fish mint (the semicircle shaped leaf that’s shiny dark green on top and matte light green on the bottom). The dipping sauce is very light in taste in my opinion.\n\nThis was a good dinner for me. If anything, I wished there were more meat rolls and that’s why I docked a star off. But apart from that, this was good.",

Eaten many delicious Vietnamese food and love it.\n\nThis is a small restaurant with basic table chairs with fan only. Charges for tissues and water.\n\nI was completely disappointed with such 'Michelin Selected' venue. The meat was dried and just a few pieces accompanied of with a small amount of vegetables unlike other restaurants. The meat was dried and sitting on tray precooked. The meat roll was actually cut in half to make it seems a lot more but NO. Meat was cool already. Fraudulent marketing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Vietnamese foods and have in the last few days tasted my similar dishes at other small mom and pop places with fantastic local and authentic Vietnamese foods. And they are not even michelin related. Saigon has many many fantastic, delicious and authentic Vietnamese foods and unfortunately this restaurant is not.",

I had a lot of fun making my own wraps using the rice paper, rice noodles and vegetables that came as part of the set. The roasted peanuts ontop of the Bò lá lốt added some fun tasty textures. I did not want my meal to end.\n\nCame after 7pm and managed to find a seat for two very easily. Service was quick and friendly.",

I loved it, but my partner couldn't eat anything except fish because even this beef roll is made with pork fat oil.\nAnyway, they were nice that they did a fish version.\n\nI liked it for the local vibe. Great value for money. I recommend it! (I prefer this than a nice restaurant for foreigners with the same food but paying tripple)...",

The veggies was fresh and you can ask for more if you want.\n\nHowever, the mắm nêm was a bit watery in my opinion. The taste was good, but it could’ve been better.\n\nThe service was really quick, a bit chaotic but efficient. The restaurant is a bit small, but expected your clothes will have some smell by the end of your meal.\n\nI’ve had better meal, so I don’t think it worth hype to check out this place.

It is tucked away in an alley. The service is punctual. You are sharing a table with other people. They have a great variety. It’s a littler pricey compared to other restaurants in HCM.

But compared to the other nicely spiced Viet dishes I had, the pancake taste fell short of whatever I had expected. Portion was generous but price is on the pricier side. However, many locals still love this place and perhaps the taste is just not for me. Give it a try nonetheless. You may love it!",

The “bánh xèo” is superb, you cannot go wrong with the special. Bring your appetite because it’s a huge portion, only ordered one for a couple and then get yourself an appetizer like ‘cha gio’.

It located in a small (not busy) street corner, felt like a community area which is great and relax. Far from the noise of the horns.\nWe only ordered there classic dish (the pancake in regular size with shrimp and pork). It was served hot and well cooked along with fresh greens to make the bites. So everything was right as it should be.\nThe kitchen setup is interesting to see, they are managing many pans simultaneously and orders keep coming! You can also see many locals coming to pick up they pancake on motorbike.",

We wanted to cancel it but the waiter was extremely rude and didn't cancel it for us.\n\nCan't understand why this place is packed with tourists - or because they are selling overpriced food for tourists only so locals don't even bother to come here!\n\nWould NOT recommend!",

The spring rolls are a bit on the heavier side of taste. Not a lot of English speaking staff but all was sorted. It was a bit more expensive than expected. 5 fried spring roll, 5 fresh spring roll, 1 banh xeo, 1 shrimp sugar cane, coke, coffee, mineral water. Totals up to almost 500k which is restaurant pricing. But the banh xeo taste was good so I wouldn’t complain, the spring rolls are also quite big.",

Loved all the food that was ordered, from the bank xeo, rice paper rolls to the spring rolls. We thought the price was reasonable for the volume and quality of the food. Highly recommend and definitely would return!",

The crispy outer layer and delicious taste are very satisfying, and there are plenty of shrimp.\n- Spring rolls is a must-order dish, very crispy, and incredibly tasty.\n- The lotus salad has a mildly spicy taste, with plenty of shrimp. When eating it, you can feel the freshness from the vegetables.\n- Good service ! reasonable price 👍🏻",

We ordered the soda water and pleasantly surprised that it is served with squeezed lime juice and sugar. Go early. We reached at 4 and the tables were already filling up fast. Still had to wait 10-15 minutes.\n*Visited again on a Wednesday evening. Place was full but no queue. We discovered that somehow, the dried spring rolls tasted better when packed home (after it has cooled).",

The dishes are quite traditional with fresh ingredients but need some small changes, like more garlic in the Prawns, less acidity in the Clams, and more juiciness in the Pork Belly but all in all an enjoyable meal. Expect to spend about US$50 per person with a bottle of wine.\n\nA big minus was that they told us they were out of the bone marrow after we already put in the order, and we were some of the first people in the restaurant. The wait staff should be made aware of that before service starts.",

The food is superb - we got the anchovies (very sour sauce), toastie, prawns (amazing but the sauce is a bit spicy), and beets (best plate of the night). It’s also incredibly expensive! However, Service was fantastic and it’s a fine dining dream in a refined atmosphere. Next time I feel like dropping a couple million on a special dinner I’d like to come back and sample many of the other dishes!",

The food is fair, price is a little expensive for how much food you get but the service was good. I enjoyed the overall experience except for the grilled octopus which is chef’s choice but it was a bit overcooked for my liking. We spent 1.7mil for 2 people including drinks. I would come back with a bigger group to try more in their menu.",

The oysters were fresh though the presentation could do with a lot less sauce. My gazpacho was a little starchy but taste-wise was ok. Tortilla was cooked perfectly but was unfortunately ruined by a large egg shell within it. The croquettes were superb. Love the pasta and also the bean soup. The dessert didn’t work for me. I found the yogurt quite heavy and the flavours didn’t gel very well. Service wise it felt a little less attentive than we’d like and there was not much of a service recovery with the egg shell. Overall, the lunch set is good value and this is a good lunch spot if you are in the vicinity.",

All products seemed fresh and well executed, sauces and grill skills are definitely the strong points of this restaurant.\n\nSmall elements to reinforce though:\n• The bone marrow: hard to eat as placed on small rocks making the beef tartare tilt and fall.\n• Service missed to serve us the amuse bouche (chips) while all tables around us had?",

Especially, the food that made me very surprise is Marisco Paella, really tasty and perfect with me with Spanish traditional rice and some prawn, clams, mussels for topping. Besides, this place is a restobar, they also serve some good drinks like cocktails, red or white wines, beers, spirit, etc. Generally, this place is perfect and everyone must try here once time at least in your life. I will come back soon. Thank you so much Octo Team 😍",

I think timing the food is important, we want a long lunch but don't need to wait so long between courses. Also, if 1 person has their main dish, all people should have their main dish too. That being said, the food was fantastic, cava was crispy, sangria was beautiful, and there were nice N/a drinks too. Comfortable table with lots of space. Nice room, beautiful bar.",

So far the wine selection remains good, but the waiting time for food is longer than expected.\nThe staff had explained afterward and treat the squids which waited for around 20-25mins. And the reason is the kitchen found that they make a wrong step and re-do. Maybe the explanation come earlier is better than the last.\nOverall, it’s still one of my favorites in the town. Everything will going better and looking forward to the next round if any for new dishes recommend by them.",

We got the festive tasting menu that was offered (December) and everything was pretty good, pork chop was a bit dry and the chargrilled sourdough had a bit too much garlic smothered on it but still good. Complimentary chips were amazing, lol. Service was great. Drinks were good. I’m from the states but live in Vietnam about 1/3 the year- If I was craving tapas again, I’d probably try out the other tapas in the city before returning here though.",

The restaurant has a tranquil courtyard with a lily palm and several miniature coconut trees for seating. The market atmosphere of a small town in the South is captured in the dining room's food display section for a local touch of interior.

An interesting part is the open kitchen counters which are located at the sides where you can see them cook the food.\n\nWe ordered the grilled beef rolls, a crab noodle soup dish and the escargots. I really liked the grilled beef rolls.\n\nDrinks are good as well, and the price is very reasonable. Popular by locals and tourists alike.",

In the hustle bustle of crowded streets and busy markets of Ho Chi Minh city, it comes as welcome change. The place is so artistically created with greenery all around, that the food becomes secondary. The restaurant staff is well groomed to be extremely polite and courteous to every customer, as is so evident. Nonetheless, it is worth highlighting that the food was absolutely amazing and for a vegan like a few in our group, the taste was unique and appealing to the palate. This is a sure place not to be missed if w visiting Ho Chi Minh city.",

Adorned with an appealing colonial-style decor, the ambience adds a unique touch to the dining experience. In addition to Vietnamese dishes, the menu extends to encompass Chinese cuisine as well. However, the service leaves something to be desired; it's rather lackluster and tends to be time-consuming, especially when requesting the bill.\n\nUnfortunately, the culinary aspect doesn't quite measure up to the establishment's reputation. The quality of the food doesn't align well with the prices charged. Specifically, the spring rolls are marred by overly dried and thick skin, prompting the decision to abandon consuming it altogether. Similarly, the skewers are plagued by overcooking, rendering the meat disappointingly dry. Adding an unexpected twist to the scene, a wild cat was observed roaming within the restaurant during our visit.\n\nIf your goal is to savor authentic Vietnamese flavors, it might be wise to explore other dining options that promise a more satisfying culinary experience. However, if your interest lies primarily in immersing yourself in the ambiance, this restaurant could still serve as a passable choice for inquisitive tourists.",

I have to admit, when you step inside it really is impressive, however after finding that all plants are made of plastic you might look with different eyes. The food was average.

We ordered the fish in clay pot with sour soup, assortment of rice cakes, and beef noodle stir fry. The fish was a very small portion and very fatty. The rice cakes were a bit too salty and just not to our taste, perhaps good if you are familiar with them. The stir fry was good. The prices were reasonable, but the service was slow and the restaurant was huge—we were seated in a corner upstairs rather in the nice space outside.",

I did see a rat.\nLost my appetite. We mentioned it to the staff and she bravely tried to guard me away from it.\n\nMy husband and I were brainstorming solutions - Either you could play the rat frequency or get a cat. The staff did let a cat out 😂😂",

Pricing is literally cheap.  Do your reservations before going, as thy are always quite packed.  An instagrammable place, very photogenic but not airconditioned.    Don’t go if the weather is too hot.",

The menu consists of different cuisines from Vietnamese to Asian, hence it is a place for ones who can have a selection to choose from aside from the local dishes.\n\nI love my grilled chicken & vermicelli, some dimsum and the food comes rather quickly. I do recommend this place if you are visiting Saigon !",

                              "We ordered the lemon basil fried rice, fried spring roll and grilled pork mixed plate, one fresh spring roll and chicken skewer. The fresh spring roll was disappointing. 95% of the filling was just rice noodles. The fried spring roll and grilled pork were delicious. Lemon basil fried rice had crab meat as topping. It was nice. Something new for us. I liked the rice grain was slightly crunch. The chicken skewers were nice but nothing special.\n\nThe restaurant looked really nice and the atmosphere was great as well. Additionally there were various options of food to  choose. However, most of the staffs looked like they had a bad day. It felt a bit awkward to ask the waiters for something because it’s as if they were bothered. There is definitely room for improvement in the customer service and hospitality.",

                              "If you are a tourist and want to enjoy Vietnamese food without going to lots of restaurants to do so, this is the place for you to give a try.\nThis place has great atmosphere with semi-private tables and great decor.  There are semi-private rooms that open to other dining rooms within the restaurant.  There are upstair dining rooms if you prefer.  The decor is kinda European, Asian, and middle eastern all mixed in.  Lots of bright colors and variety of furniture are decorated in the restaurant.  There are lots of plants and a pond on the first floor.\nVarious Vietnamese food options are available from soups to salads to variety of beverages.\nOne of my favorites is the steamed chicken served with sticky rice and chicken salad on the same platter.  There are small bites like egg rolls, bánh khọt ( petite round shrimp cakes), and baby clams served with cracker.  Beverages are available from cocktails to juices and iced tea. The Ngon  cocktail is a passion fruit beverage is a great choice.\nThe menu is extensive so you can actually come here a few time while you’re in Saigon.\nIt cost around $80 for a party of five to dine at Ngon Restaurant.  It is affordable for most tourists.\nI will come here again if I ever come back to Vietnam.",

There are 3 different pizza options (mushroom, eggplant and kale) that can be turned vegan. Have not tried the kale yet but it looks delicious.\n\nThis is our go to restaurant because it is super family friendly and accommodating for our little 1 year old. I've been to this location about 6 times and every time I feel the staff try and go above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable.\n\nThis particular time, we got free dessert because they thought our table was too small. It wasn't. But they do stuff like that to make us feel special everytime.\n\nThere is usually a 30 min wait if you don't have reservations. Super easy to book a table on Google.",

Personally I preferred the beef, the cheese pizza is a bit plain for my taste but you get a selection of sauces to add if you like, I recommend the honey on the cheese.\n\nWe also drank some iced coffee, the Café Latte was good, not sweet. The Vietnamese style white coffee was similar but sweeter, which I preferred to the latte.\n\nFor desert we ate their Tiramisu, which was quite nice.\n\nStaff were friendly and would promptly clear away used dishes. Food was quicker than they said, although we ate after the normal lunch rush and the restaurant wasn\'t busy.',

With multiple locations throughout the city, it has become a go-to spot for pizza enthusiasts like us.\n\nAs always, the food lived up to its well-earned fame. The pizza was scrumptious, with a perfect balance of flavors and a delightful crust that left us wanting more. Each bite was a reminder of why this restaurant has garnered such popularity among pizza lovers.\n\nWhile the food was exceptional, we did encounter a slight hiccup with the staff. Compared to other branches we've visited, the service here seemed a bit less polished. There were a few mistakes made with our food order, which was a tad disappointing. However, what truly stood out was the attitude of the staff.\n\nDespite the errors, the staff members were incredibly friendly, attentive, and apologetic for any inconvenience caused. They took immediate action to rectify the situation and went above and beyond by offering us complimentary yogurt as a dessert. Their kind gestures and willingness to make amends truly impressed us, showcasing their dedication to customer satisfaction.\n\nIn addition to their warm hospitality, this particular location introduced a remarkable addition to their team – a waiter robot. We were pleasantly surprised by this innovative touch, as the robot efficiently navigated the restaurant, delivering orders with precision and adding a fun element to our dining experience. It was a delightful blend of tradition and modernity.\n\nVisiting this restaurant is always a pleasure, and despite the minor service hiccup, we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The delectable pizza, coupled with the sincere and friendly attitude of the staff, made our visit memorable. The introduction of the waiter robot was an exciting bonus, adding a touch of novelty to the dining ambiance.\n\nIf you're in the mood for some outstanding pizza and appreciate a restaurant that constantly strives for innovation, this place is a must-visit. Indulge in their delicious offerings, relish the friendly atmosphere, and witness the charm of the waiter robot. It's an experience that combines culinary delight with a dash of modern marvel.\n\nWe'll certainly be returning to this restaurant in the future, eagerly anticipating the delightful pizza and the warm hospitality that awaits us.",

Portions for the other dishes were a bit small for my expectations but we still left all full. Service was very attentive and servers spoke very good English, our server was Truc/ Jenny! :) thank you~ will come back with other guests.",

The carbonara pasta was good as well, and so was the beef pasta. Flavor is well imposed and creamy. The only thing that was weird to me was the mashed potatoes and the bread? Maybe because I am American haha. But nevertheless it was good and I enjoyed every ounce of it. Definitely recommend. Check this place out!",

The single-room dining space exudes an austere industrial exterior but feels theatrical once inside.",

                              "We visited the restaurant to celebrate a spacial occasion with my wife, and to be honest, we weren’t prepared to have such an amazing experience at Nen Light.\n\n- the location: the restaurant is an alley within an alley in a corner of CBD centre of Saigon but it is also easy to find. It feels like an oasis to hide away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\n- the restaurant: in term of design, the restaurant attracted me right when we walked in with it zen garden. Minimal, elegant, and spacious, it is hard to believe you can find such space in District 1. Time passes by slower here. Love it. One of the most beautiful restaurant in the city in my opinion.\n\n- the food: we ordered the Sto:ry Menu (a 8-course tasting menu with underlying story for each dish). The food is where we are touched most. No gimmick, no fancy caviar or wagyu, the simple local ingredients which we Vietnamese can find everyday in the market is elevated to another height, put under spot light and touched our hearts with the story behind each dish. It is the story of Vietnamese food and culture! Chef Summer’s food is not only about combination of flavors and techniques, it is also about her philosophical view of the world.\n\nOverall, the dining experience here is an unforgettable memory for both of us. To best enjoy the experience, allow yourself to relax and immerse in their story telling menu.\n\nThank you, the team Nen Light!",

Their menu elevates Vietnamese ingredients creatively, including unique elements like sea almonds and tree sap that surprised us 😀. The wine and sake pairings were really good, and the attentive, knowledgeable staff made our visit more enjoyable. Highly recommended!",

                              "Went for the 7 course short experience tasting menu with 6 glass wine pairing.\n\nOverall experience as great. The service was very attentive, our server was patient and spared much effort and time in explaining the particular components of each and every dish. The service alone is rather commendable and deserving of a Michelin star.\n\nHighlights included the “Y” Tendon, the Duck, the Mi Quang (Noodle) and the longan Ice Cream. The banana chocolate offered at the end also paired well with the pour over coffee (which was part of the menu).\n\nWasn’t too big of a fan of the fish, was too tough and fishy for my liking. The “wax sou vide” technique was however creative and intuitive.\n\nWine pairing was good, had a lot of variety, ranging from Sake to Wine. They also sourced a few organic wines which were quite left field and interesting.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, I would recommend others to give this restaurant a try and I would most likely come back for another visit (would prob go for their veg option given their green Michelin Star).\n\nPS. Their menu does change depending on the seasons, so dishes offered might be subject to variation. They also allowed us to take away their menu in the form of “q-cards” which was a very nice touch.",

Our entire experience was delightful, from the exquisite cuisine to the flawless execution. The individual responsible for this culinary feat is nothing short of a genius. Likely credited to this, my husband– an Executive Chef– approves of this restaurant. It was refreshing and enlightening to discover the unique flavors of Vietnamese cuisine. We express sincere gratitude towards the exceptional service we received. Although it is uncertain, we believe our server's names to be Ely, Ting, Yout, and Bach. Thank you very much!!! ☺️",

Food was amazingly good, balanced and flavorful. We ordered from à la carte menu: Mì Quảng with pesto sauce and abalone, amberjack mousse, longan flower honey ice cream and a sake called Nanbubijin (Nam Bộ Mỹ Nhân in Vietnamese).\n\nThe dining hall is quite small, has around 8 tables but somehow it felt so private. They had nice choices of background music as well.\n\nDefinitely will come back for their flagship Story Menu. Overall, unique and exciting experience, highly recommend if you have passion for hyper local Vietnamese cuisine!",

                              "Really high expectations - left really disappointed.\n\nWe cancelled another reservation at a really popular place to come here having read reviews and seen it was Michelin selected.\n\nThe meal started off well. First few courses were tasty and interesting.\n\nFrom here it went downhill. The noodles with eggshell in them were inedible the texture was just too much to handle for anyone.\n\nThe next course was described as a snail to us in the description while the flavour was good the texture was again too difficult to stomach.\n\nFinally the third main course dish was chicken and rice. On its own it was pleasant however little flavour. You then added an option of different spices. We started eating this dry before the waiter then poured green tea over it. Hard to tell if this was supposed to be dry and then wet or wet all along.\n\nFinally dessert was ok and an improvement on the main courses.\n\nAt the end of the meal we were asked for ‘reflections’ on the courses. We were very open on our feelings that we had been disappointed by the middle courses and wrote this down.\n\nThese thoughts were taken away and seemingly thrown in the bin given the lack of response or acknowledgement from the team.\n\nWe did challenge the management on this that having not really enjoyed our meal would they be willing to make an offer to reduce the bill. Not about the money but more about the gesture/principal.\n\nThe response was a reduction of 10% - we found this quite insulting and not at all the service we are accustomed to.\n\nIt’s definitely experimental if that’s what you want to try but just be warned that you may be left disappointed.\n\nAs an aside the beer we were served was out of date. They replaced my bottle because I pointed it out but not my wife’s who was probably the same.",

The wine pairing worked well in the beginning 5 dishes, then the sake didnt really paired well towards the ending dishes. Nothing was served hot, not even the roasted duck, that's disappointing. The Isopad was a good experience, tasted like crab meat. Like the Slipper Lobster the most but that was just a bite size in the first course unfortunately 😕",

A female chef, a culinary journey with wine pairings, and a wealth of new discoveries in terms of taste, texture, presentation, and even cultural insights. We thoroughly enjoyed every moment, especially the playful aspects of the cooking and ingredients.\n\nThe staff also give you the option to choose the level of communication you prefer, which was greatly appreciated. They provided cards with insights and explanations directly from the chef, adding a special touch to the meal.\n\nThe experience was wonderful, even down to the restrooms, where you can enjoy Japanese-style toilets.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of small disappointments. The chef left without meeting her guests, and although they asked during the booking about the occasion – our wedding anniversary – there was no acknowledgment of it during our visit. It left me feeling it was just for statistic purpose.",

Having been to quite a few fine dining restaurants myself, some of those with Michelin stars, I must say Nén is among the top restaurants that I have been too.\n\nThe concept and story are unique and engaging and the dishes are very well balanced and bursting with flavours. The menu are changed regularly and very well thought out to create not only a flow of taste but also a flow of story which highlights personal connection of the dishes and ingredients to the chef and Nén team. Nén also offers impeccable service from the staff, making the whole experience a very intimate one. My pregnancy dietary requirement was very well noted from the reservation time and the team went the extra mile to create beautiful alternative dishes to specifically fit my needs.\n\nOverall, Nén successfully creates a truly unforgettable dining experience and I would not hesitate to recommend Nén to anyone who would like to experience world-class fine dining.",

The chef and her team bring forth a Vietnamese fine dining experience with locally sourced ingredients with quintessential flavours. It would be extremely unfair to just select 1 dish as favourite, and hence I won’t do that injustice.\n\nThe restaurant was also kind to cater to my shellfish allergy, which is a testament to their service quality.\n\nA Michelin star awaits.\n\nA 1000% recommendation to anyone staying in or visiting Ho Chi Minh.",

ESTA’s tasting menu (in addition to a mainstay a la carte menu) changes seasonally to embody the different seasons of Vietnam through its array of in-season vegetables, fruits and protein like Dalat cherry tomatoes, sun-ripened stone fruits and exquisite Korean turbot, prepared over an open flame.",

I think background music should be more careful selected. And with small ambience, it’s very noisy if a group of people gather here. Food (including dessert) and wine are good and worth the price I think. I like lamb with coriander (very creative). Waiters are all nice and friendly. Well experience! Bring your partner, friends or customers here, for sure they will like this place. Don’t forget to indulge yourself with an Italian sparkling wine ok?",

                              "Visited in Jul 2023\n\nGood restaurant with an Asian fusion menu. There are 2 menus - a la carte and tasting. I was really impressed with the food quality and the presentation. The flavours were quite exquisite. I tried 3 starters (pork jowl with hiraki egg, bluefin tuna and foie gras, wild caught cobia with mustard leaf) and each of them were brilliant. For the mains, I ordered the duck, and the dish presentation was one of the best I’ve ever seen - taste was fantastic too. Overall food wise, this is a 5/5 place.\n\nOnly reason for a 4 rating is that the service was a bit odd. When I sat down I was given a wine/drinks menu and then was never asked if I wanted any drinks. Also, I went in with the intention of trying the tasting menu, but was suggested to go for the a-la-carte menu when I mentioned my shellfish allergy. Then while ordering items from the a-la-carte menu, the restaurant was able to remove & replace certain ingredients from dishes to cater to my allergy - which left me confused as to why they could not have done it for the tasting menu.\n\nIn any case, this place is worth going to. Would be a definite recommendation for ppl visiting HCM.",

                              "Esta is absolutely amazing. We would not have known about this place if the staff manager, Mr. Trańg, did not approach us way before their opening hours to share about their restaurant and philosophy. The atmosphere is very cozy, and it is great to be able to see the fire at work, cooking all the delicious dishes. The food is brilliant, and kudos to Chef Long Cuong in putting together simple ingredients perfectly to create complex and intricate flavours seamlessly. The A4 wagyu is a must-try, it absolutely melts in your mouth! We also really loved the pork jowl. This is one of the best place for wine pairings. Mr. Trańg was also very nice to introduce to us what the Karaya Gum is. We really loved that they went out of their way to serve us. Well done to the service team.",

                              "While Esta’s food certainly did not lack flavor, given the different ingredients to create various tones in its dishes, I feel that it lacked harmony and thought some ingredients were randomly chosen to create a “thematic” menu. Meanwhile, staff needs more training for the restaurant to deliver the premium it charges to its customers fully.\n\nLast weekend, my friends and I tried Esta’s summer-themed tasting menu. Of the eight dishes, I thought the beef tartare with plum gochujang and ox back marrow was good – they all blended well together, creating an altogether new beef tartare dish not usually served elsewhere. The cold buckwheat noodle with summer vegetables was probably one of my favorites, as this hit the “summer theme”, given the sweet and fresh flavors the dish delivered.\n\nEverything else, however, was average. The pork jowl with abalone and hiraki egg felt forced, as the egg overpowered both the pork and abalone (which I didn’t taste much). I also felt that the quality of the pork was just average. Similarly, for the fried rice topped with Hokkaido sea urchin – the sea urchin overpowered the fried rice (which I think was ok). The unicorn leatherjacket fish with curry leaves – more of like cabbage with some fish, and the fish lacked flavor. The desserts were also disappointing. It tasted like the sweet, tart, and sour elements from the different ingredients were fighting against each other and not blending in harmony.\n\nMeanwhile, although the staff was attentive, it seemed as if they didn’t know what they were doing. They recommended a wine-tasting menu to go with the food menu but did not know exactly how much it was or which wines were included. We ended up ordering a bottle of white wine, but they served it not chilled. It also felt that they weren’t enthusiastic when explaining the dishes.\n\nOverall, Esta lacked the “Yummm!” experience my friends and I would usually say from the looks, smell, and taste of the food. I guess the lack of the wow factor from the presentation of the food down to its smell was an indication of what was to come in terms of taste. At a lower price point, I would have rated this restaurant higher. But with its current prices, I believe the restaurant is overcharging its customers for the quality and experience it delivers. There is always room for improvement, though, as some of its dishes almost hit the mark (e.g., the duck, which is not on the tasting menu, is must try), and staff can continuously improve given the proper training.",

                              "First time came to Ho Chi Minh City, one of our friend recommended us to try this place. Since we love trying new restaurants in different cities we booked it for our 2nd night during our trip.\n\nThe welcome was great. Super friendly staffs. When they show us the menu.\n\nWe just have a few comments - first, with regard to the service:\n\n1. We were recommended by our friend that we should share one tasting menu, as the staff recommended him and his partner to do that and just add from the a la carte menu to share. However, the staff there said that we cannot share, and insisted that we each have a tasting menu. We just did that and realized the tasting menu can actually be shared given the portion of the serving.\n\n2. The staff recommended us to do wine paring. When we asked how much it was, he said “just a little”, though when we pressed him with the cost, apparently, it is the same cost as the tasting menu.\n\n3. We ended up ordering a bottle of white wine. What we wanted wasn’t available, which was fine, so ordered another bottle. However, when the wine arrived, it wasn’t even chilled when they served it.\n\n4. One of the dishes in the tasting menu - abalone, pork jole, hirake egg - the egg yolk was supposed to be intact as shown in the photo. However, they served the dish with the yolk broken and didn’t even bother to replate. They asked me if it was fine - I did not agree to this. What they did was to just replace the egg but did not plate it as it was originally intended.\n\n5. Music choice is very odd, it’s a fine dining restaurant but they are playing top pop hits. Which is a bit strange.\n\nOverall, the food are good but only 3 dishes out of 8 are unique. we just feel like the service wasn’t on point for the price that they charging as Michelin recommended list.",

From start to finish, the experience was exceptional, and I can't wait to share my thoughts.\n\nThe ambiance at Esta Saigon is inviting and cozy, setting the stage for what turned out to be an unforgettable evening. The standout feature for me was the personalized touch in the service. The staff, while maintaining a professional demeanor, were incredibly friendly and attentive. What truly set Esta Saigon apart was the visit from the chef himself - Chef Long Cuong. He took the time to come to our table and passionately explain the intricate details of the dishes, including the fascinating process of fermenting the sourdough. It was a delightful experience to gain insight into the craftsmanship behind the food we were about to enjoy.\n\nSpeaking of the food, every dish was a culinary delight. The flavors were bold, and the presentation was nothing short of artistry.\n\nEsta Saigon has undoubtedly raised the bar when it comes to dining experiences in the area. My sincere thanks to Chef Long Cuong, Mr. Trang Nguyen - Restaurant Manager and the entire team for making this dining experience truly special.",

There is absolutely nothing that anyone could complain about as literally every single detail is perfect. Profesional service with good manners but not too polite, always willing to explain but not bombarding you with name of every ingredient. Young but talented team with bold yet supple Chef who’s eager to talk with you and take under consideration your preferences. And last but not least, the food. Perfect balance between saltiness, sourness, sweetness, bitterness and just a hint of spiciness. High quality freshly sourced local ingredients, prepared and cook to the perfection.\nKanpachi, toothfish, mallard and lamb chop make your umami taste buds fire and all over again while butter honeycomb bread (sic!) and chocolate hazelnut cake with brown butter ice cream are perfect sweet finish.\nI spend five long weeks discovering cuisine in all over Vietnam but succeeded to find only three such excellent venues and this is definitely number one.",

I had their steak, a salad, raw oysters and a fish dish.\nThen came again last year and everything went downhill, probably cause I had high expectations or Idk if they’re losing their quality because of bigger customer ranges? The duck co fit, and the steal was way too hard to chew.

Bought my souvenirs here and spent over 1.5m đ. The chocolate mug is divine. Perfectly balanced between Chantilly, cake, praline, cookies, etc. Had to force myself to slow down. There are many satellite stores but this is the flagship and stuff is made on site!",

The quality of the chocolate did not disappoint - they were buttery smooth without any bitterness, even the dark chocolate.\nThe chocolate tart had light chocolate mousse sitting kn top of dark chocolate sponge and a tasty biscuit. Pieces of dark chocolate cubes sat within the mousse.\nI wasn't as amazed with the chocolate mint cake - it was mint and chocolate mousse layers separated by a soft sponge. The mint mousse tasted slightly artificial.\nThe coffee was well made and well worth coming here just for that.\nNow for their specialty chocolates - superb. There were so many varieties and they all went well together. Surprising combinations like chocolate with tamarind actually tasted delicious. Can't wait to try them all out.",

(But it’s not hot, so they didn’t toast it)\n\nSignature choc drink is good, we had it cold. Iced coffee is nice too, but it has a European coffee taste with a sour bitter aftertaste- good tho!\n\nBanana muffin was delicious. Macaroons was decent, nothing to shout about.\n\nGreat place for gifts/souvenirs.",

Maybe a chocolate connoisseur could? Because I don't particularly enjoy chocolate except for specific ones. The tart is very sweet which I can't finish alone, would be good for sharing. It just taste like chocolate tart.\n\n👎 They have small little chocolates but you can only select for dine in. Otherwise you can only get prepackaged gift boxes but you cannot select the flavours.\n\n🤑 The price is relatively affordable considering that it is considered a popular Brand at least amongst tourists.\n\n🔥 I wouldn't mind going back again but I'll probably order something different. Would recommend for chocolate lovers or enthusiasts but if you are just like me you can give this stop a skip.",

You will be welcomed by cocoa smell, with a bright decoration and shelves full of chocolate and chocolates related products that are locally sourced. I bought some chocolate for Mother’s Day and the chocolate didn’t disappoint with their taste (10/10 from my mom)\n\nPricing for the chocolate though is on the expensive side for locals and probably marketed towards tourists more, making it much more unique for locals like me. This also means buying Maison’s chocolate for special occasions will be greatly appreciated by your loved ones\n\nThe atmosphere itself is quiet and calm, so this is a great place for a coffee catch up with friends.",

                              "Indulging in Maison Marou's exquisite chocolate and pastries is truly a sensory journey. The rich, velvety chocolates exhibit a perfect balance of premium cocoa, creating a symphony of flavors that dance on the palate. The pastries, meticulously crafted, are a testament to artistry and taste, delivering a delightful combination of flakiness and decadence. Maison Marou elevates the sweet experience, making it a must-visit for connoisseurs seeking unparalleled quality and craftsmanship.\n\nMaison Marou's croissant is a masterpiece of pastry perfection. Delicately crisp on the outside, the golden layers unfold with a satisfying flakiness, revealing a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth interior. Each bite is a harmonious blend of textures, with a subtle sweetness that complements the rich, authentic buttery flavor.\n\nThe pain au chocolat is a sinful delight that elevates the classic pastry to new heights. The buttery layers, flawlessly laminated, cradle a symphony of decadence within. What sets it apart is the infusion of Maison Marou's exceptional chocolate—rich, velvety, and seamlessly woven into each flaky fold. As you savor this indulgence, the juxtaposition of butteriness and chocolate decadence creates a culinary symphony that is nothing short of extraordinary. Each bite is a luxurious journey into the heart of indulgence.\n\nIt’s irresistible chocolate cookie is a sensory delight that transcends ordinary indulgence. The fragrance alone, a symphony of cocoa and butter, hints at the exquisite experience awaiting you. With every bite, the cookie unveils a perfect balance—rich, decadent chocolate oozing from a tender yet not overly sweet dough.",

Some of their high end chocolate tastes really great, with great texture and balanced sweetness. I really do enjoy the cashew chocolate, both of their country largest export plants. You dont feel the hard layer of the cashew as i believe it had been grinned into powder form.",

                              "Maison Marou is a place to visit for chocolate lovers in Vietnam.\nCafe sells its own in house chocolate - bars, bonbons, cocoa powder as well as a range of chocolate infused food/drink.\nPersonal favorite is the hot chocolate and cookie (have it heated up on the spot) - Hot chocolate has a good balance of the bitterness of the cocoa and milk without being too milky or sweet.\nCookie has more chocolate than cookie, which I appreciate.\nThe rest of the desserts are nice, My personal opinion is that the chocolate is better than the pastry. Example: The chocolate in the Opera cake is good and the chocolate pieces are perfectly tempered, but the cake layer itself isn't as outstanding as the chocolate. Coffee ice cream was on the icy side. Tiramisu was decent but not outstanding.\nMilkshake is delicious, leaning towards milky rather than a thick shake\nBonbons - The one with orange ganache was the most outstanding. Salted caramel was decent, but peanut/Cashew praline was underwhelming. Hazelnut praline goes better with chocolate, which unfortunately wasn't available.",

The packaging is gorgeous and perfect for gifting because it explains the chocolate and it’s easy to buy a sampler pack in lots of different size options. The chocolate drink was delicious, but what I’m really excited for are the bars. I appreciate the attention to detail, visuals, and storytelling (as well as, of course, ingredients).",

I was torn between the Chilli & Cinnamon one, and the staff was sweet enough to add that as additional sprinkles for me. The chocolate was rich, and came with an added spicy kick from the cinnamon & chilli powder.\n\nThe brownie was good, with a moist goey centre, not the usual crumbly sort. I enjoyed chilling there...\n\nDefinitely pricy by Vietnam hcmc standards but one comes here for a different experience and chocolate is always a sweet INDULGENCE.",

Both coffee choices they provide taste good, black one and milky one.\n\nThe Baguette 🥖 bread is crunchy outside yet soft inside. The sunny side eggs 🍳 are so fresh and tasty, it blended nicely with ham and sausages. Pickles and mashed liver pate as side dishes make the flavor rounder.\n\n5 star all day savoury breakfast. Love to visit soon ❤️😃👏🏻👏🏻",

Comes with 2 eggs with assorted meats,  fried pork, pork Pate and ham.  So satisfying after the meal.  Highly recommended local breakfast and please come early to avoid disappointment. 😁😁😁😁",

The hot plate keeps everything warm and nice.  The baguette is served warm.   Really nice with accompanying pate tip with margarine.   Coffee was awesome and cheap and just got to have a second one!!\n\nSitting is immediate by the alleyway.   They will set up table for you as soon as you indicate you wanna eat there.   Staff do speak simple English.     Service is fast.\n\nWorthwhile trip but alleyway have vehicle movement of bike parking right beside your table.",

If you visit Saigon, you have to visit this place for breakfast to enjoy the original taste of almost half of century. It's always crowded with people at the morning, so if all tables are filled, be patient for 5 minutes, you would be served after all. It's worth to give it a try.",

                              'This shop offers delicious "banh my chao" or "pan bread" for breakfast. As of September 2023, the price for a mixed portion is 60k, which includes 2 soft-boiled omelets, 3 generous pieces of fried pork sausage, 1 slice of pate, and 5 slices of ham. All of these items are served in a small, warm metal pan. Additionally, you\'ll receive a small cup of pickled carrots and radishes, as well as a loaf of bread.\n\nThe shop is located on Cao Thang street, although please note that there is no indoor seating available. Instead, you\'ll find seating options along the alley, adjacent to the shop. The seating consists of the typical small plastic chairs and tables, commonly seen and popular in Vietnam. While there is no air conditioning, the lively atmosphere of the alley and the nearby school creates a vibrant ambiance where you\'ll be seated.\n\nIt can get crowded during peak breakfast hours (7 to 9 am). Therefore, you may expect to wait in line for a short period of time before being seated.',

Like a symphony in our mouth, explosion of flavours and textures!\n\nHighly recommended if you wish to try something different. However, there is not many seatings indoor, a heads up here.

Their menu without a price listed can feel a bit intransparent. The popiah was delicious, but the pan-fried garlic chive dumplings and the spring rolls were unremarkable. Unfortunately, the high prices and somewhat rude staff (who seemed to stare at customers excessively) detracted from the experience.",

Edges are crisp and goes well with a mouthful of pickled vegetable and fish sauce. It took us a while to find it but we liked it because it was such a hidden find. Try it if you're nearby!",

Went here late and they were open and welcoming. The teenagers speak excellent English, anyway the menu is in English also so no problem!!",

They know some English but they also offer a menu with pictures and descriptions so its not too hard to order. Recommended place to discover and experience.\n\nOrdered the following:\n1. Bot chien, a fried rice flour with egg and green papaya on the side with soy and chili dipping sauce. Its like an omelette. I liked it, but my friends didnt, all up to preference in taste I guess. Give it a try 😊\n\n2. Goi cuon. Fresh Vietnamese spring roll with pork, shrimp, and salad. A staple Vietnamese dish. Always good, especially with the dipping sauce.\n\n3. Ha cao, pork dumplings. Also good, a bit more wrapper than filling but still okay.\n\nAcross from them there are also other local restaurants to check out. Worth the visit.",

The menu is limited allowing them to focus on their signature dishes. You fill out a paper menu to order and our Bun Cha came out within minutes. The flavour is good, tiny hint of spice that lingers on your lips, charcoal favour of the meat and simple noodles to finish it off. I load my spoon and then dip it in the sauce. There is chilli on the beef sticks but not unbearable, enough to make you order a drink! Shortly after being seated, there was a line out the door. Highly recommended. Total bill for 2 people, $12!!",

The fried beef tastes like hot dog.  If I didn’t have cheaper and better tasting food elsewhere already I might had been ok with it. But we felt this was too much money for what you get.   But hey, the restaurant is on a street with a lot of foreigners and pubs where banh mi is 2-3x the price elsewhere, so what can I say?",

Ordered the bun cha (60VND) and fried spring rolls (35VND), pretty mid in my opinion. This was my first bun cha, either the restaurant is not doing it justice or the dish is not for me. The grilled pork had no lingering charred flavour, the dish basically tasted like pork meatballs in fish sauce. I had high expectations of the spring rolls, which were made to order, but for some reason they stick to my teeth? Not the most pleasant to eat.",

If it's your first time having this type of food, the owner is very happy to explain the proper way to eat it.\nFor the ambiance and service you get, this place is a steal. Get there mid afternoon if you don't want to wait for a table. Lunch, dinner, and late evening can get pretty busy and I've seen lines out the door 10-15 deep.",

However, I would say, this is nothing compared to Hanoi’s real thing. But this is an ok alternative if you can’t get to Hanoi. Located in the middle of Bui Vien street - famous for its pubs. It can get pretty noisy.\nThis place has very limited seating - meant to cater to 2-3 pax per table. They only take cash. No CC. Prices are on the high side.",

A short wait as restaurant was small. Waitresses were very good. Got ready seats for us while we wait.\n\nRecommend!!",

Fried fish with green rice was a bit disappointing, it turned out to be fish ball instead of fish, the center wasn’t very well fried and still a bit cold.\n\nOverall is good!",

However, I decided not to go there anymore.\n\nBurger bread was not fully defrozen and still stayed cold. The pork rib was not soft, tender, and jiucy like before. It seemed like the sauce was just pasted and covered outside right before serving. French fries were covered with black soot that showed they used the oil too long.\nYou will understand the above from my pictures.\nI don't know if the owner was changed or not, but I am sorry, Quan Ut Ut, instead, I am going to try to find out alternative American BBQ.\n\nIf any of you, reading this, want to experience the bad one, go there. If you don't want to, dare not to try......",

My wife says two years ago when she was last here in HCMC the food was amazingly delicious. She was very disappointed this time and for my first time eating here I couldn’t believe how bad it was. My wife said they used to have a giant smoker out front which was not there when we went so curious if they are still smoking the meats or not. We had a platter with a little of everything and the sausage was quite good but outside of that everything else shockingly bad. Ribs very tough and hard to get the meat off. I hear the ribs used to be very tender and falling off the bone. Chicken was so so. Fries had apparently changed from a couple years ago and seemed frozen and not fresh. Maybe we’ll try the one in D2",

I gave the food 4 stars only because I have had better BBQ once while in an international destination, but this was a good “B” vs BBQ in the US. In Vietnam, specifically Saigon, you won’t find a better place. Servers and staff were great, I was well tended to and never needed to ask for service, and the place is temperature controlled. I ate there after the lunch hour, but before “dinner time”\n\nIf you’re looking to take a break from the delicious Vietnamese flavors, and want a little taste from home - this will surely hit the spot.",

The combos and food is a sharable food spot. By yourself it can be a lot but you can still order for smaller parties like 1-4. The smoke flavor on the meet is pretty good but not as moist. Smoke chicken and pig is the way to go. Ribs is almost fall off the bone but not there yet. Flavor 1-10 is 6.5 kinda mediocre. I think the smoke sausage mightve been the best thing there yet. 2nd place would be the chicken",

                              "First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to the kitchen for preparing such delicious dishes tonight.\n\nThe presence of an Asian fusion on the menu brings about a sense of harmony; however, the predominant taste leans towards Thai cuisine.\n\nTo start off my dinner, I indulged in two portions of beef and shrimp dumplings. The shrimp dumplings had a golden crust, a chewy texture, and firm, sweet shrimp meat (although the sauce was quite spicy for my liking). On the other hand, the beef dumplings had a chewy shell made from Japanese rice flour, tender beef, and a non-spicy sesame sauce. Interestingly, even when eaten with the sesame sauce, the shrimp dumplings still proved to be a delightful and delicious choice due to their lack of spiciness.\n\nBeing a fan of fried foods, I found myself torn between ordering fried chicken or fried squid, so I decided to have both for the purpose of comparison. Both dishes boasted a crispy golden fried dough crust. The fried chicken had tender meat, accompanied by a sweet and salty dipping sauce that was not spicy. As for the fried squid, it showcased the tenderness of seafood complemented by a sweet and creamy sauce. These shared dishes are particularly suitable for groups or two or more people, allowing them to be enjoyed together. Personally, I found the fried squid more preferable, as the fried chicken tended to be a bit dry and lacked excitement when consumed alone.\n\nDue to its embodiment of the typical Thai taste, I opted to order Tom Yum. The broth possessed a perfect consistency, an eye-catching color, an enticing aroma derived from the herbs, and a delicate balance of sweetness, acidity, and lightness. Additionally, it featured 3 firm and sweet tiger prawns paired with Vietnamese straw mushrooms.\n\nFinally, concluding the meal with the most delectable dessert on the menu, the Banana Crepe, left an indescribable sense of excitement. The soft crust, fragrant bananas, the harmonious blend of sweet and salty notes from the caramel sauce, the richness of coconut milk, and the sweetness of coconut cream contributed to a cake that was far from dry. Each bite resulted in a harmonious fusion of flavors that evoked pure happiness.\n\nAs someone who enjoys a quieter environment, especially during the early days of the week, I truly appreciate a space that is not overly noisy. This tranquility allows me to fully savor and relish a delicious meal.",

Their happy hour is great value for money, with all their glass drinks and dumplings at 50% off from 5-8pm. Their drinks were well-made. They don't scrimp on the booze. We also loved their pork & prawn dumplings. From the à la carte menu, we enjoyed their spicy crispy chicken & brocollini. I'd go back just for the chicken really! Restrooms were excellent as well.",

They made the experience 10/10. Highly recommend. Would have preferred if they didn’t use plastic straws in the drinks and the disposable wet wipes could have just been reusable napkins.",

The restaurant deco had a modern Vietnamese feel but not overpowering with history and colours. The food was great. The shared dishes portion were plenty for 2. We enjoyed the chicken fried rice in coconut (recommended) and clam dish. In fact, we enjoyed all the food except for the fried frogs which was a letdown. If you in the district 1 area and done with eating street food, then I would recommend a visit to Den Long.",

BETTER to book a table in advance, because the restaurant is busy all the time. Staff is well trained, the interior is nice and good ventilation design. Food is tasty and fresh, with no hygiene problem.  Shop always keep it clean, and the table top will not have any single oily sticky area.",

Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes? The only dish we like was the braised/stew pork belly. The others were just mid, the flavors were not hitting.\n\nThe restaurant has AC, clean and comfortable. Interior was nicely decorated as well.\n\nStaff was friendly and accommodating.",

Not a very big portion for 95,000. Also found a bone in the chicken even though it's advertised as boneless. The fried rice in the coconut was good (better) and it costed 115,000. They do not include VAT in the price. Overall below average quality compared to other places we've been to.",

Pork and beef had nice texture. Their morning glory also ok. The rice also soft and fluffier. Excellent service and cozy place. Price a quite higher than other Restaurant.",

The online reservation, done on the day itself, was swift and easy. When we arrived, our table was ready and the service was as friendly as I remembered from my personal family trip in Dec 2022.\n\nWe ordered 5-6 dishes to share, and all of them were delicious! Not too salty, or too sweet, the perfect balance of flavours. The crew even surprised us with a complimentary side dish (a new item on their menu) which was absolutely yummy.\n\nAll of us enjoyed the food at Den Long. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine at pocket-friendly prices, we highly recommend Den Long. We will certainly return again the next trip we visit Saigon!",

The crab curry was somewhat bland, and the fish dish a bit too spicy for me. Despite arriving without a reservation, I still got a table on the third floor. Even during the busy hours, the food did not take that long to be served. With reasonable prices, I'd recommend this spot for those seeking approachable Vietnamese cuisine or exploring it for the first time.",

This place was packed when I entered and it was actually closing soon. And it’s packed with locals, so you know it has to be good. Ordered their grilled pork, pram pancakes and rolls and this place certainly deserves 5-stars all the way! Food was yummmmyyyylicious! And the portions are generous with the freshest ingredients. Prawns were big, crunchy and juicy! Certainly made my tastebuds dancing and a well worth it place to have a fully satisfied meal. Highly recommended!",

                              "We got pan seared Mekong prawn (195k) and deep-fried red tilapia (215k) Food tasted amazing. The presentation was good. Prawn dish included 5 shrimps, and red tilapia was served whole with portions separated and fried individually (see image). Service was alright, could have been improved. For instance, we are not used to having our meals served at separate times (one earlier than the other), but this may be a Vietnamese culture since they share plates. Also, one of the waitresses was watching us eat and pointing out to our meal at a  very close distance, which made me uncomfortable. There is 8% VAT added to the bill which appears typical to Saigon restaurants. No service is added to the bill, but appreciated. Overall we liked the food and ambiance and I would recommend it.",

We also ordered some prawn and pork rolls and the veggie option - both were really good.\n\nService: fast and efficient considering they had a big table next to us, we were told there was a wait, however, we received our food order after 15 mnts.\n\nAtmosphere: nestled in a narrow alley off the Main Street, it’s not too difficult to find this restaurant. Do not expect to see any locals here, most of the patrons were westerners. Great atmosphere nonetheless!",

                              "Nestled in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, it is a true gem that promises an authentic Vietnamese dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance is charmingly Vietnamese, with traditional decor and warm lighting that creates a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. The friendly and attentive staff welcomed me with genuine smiles, and their knowledge of the menu made my dining experience all the more enjoyable. Tobi was especially very attentive and friendly during my visit and recommended great food while I was there.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the lemongrass chicken. The aroma alone was enough to whet my appetite, and with the first bite, I was transported to a world of vibrant flavors. The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender, and infused with the fragrant essence of lemongrass. The accompanying sauce was a harmonious blend of sweet and tangy, enhancing the overall dish.\n\nAnother delightful dish I tried was the stir-fried morning glory. This classic Vietnamese vegetable dish was prepared with expertise, resulting in a burst of freshness and crunch in every bite. The morning glory was stir-fried to perfection, retaining its natural flavors and vibrant green color. The seasoning was well-balanced, allowing the natural taste of the vegetable to shine through.\n\nThe menu is extensive, offering a wide array of Vietnamese delicacies that cater to all palates.\n\nMoreover, the prices are reasonable, considering the quality and authenticity of the dishes. The portion sizes are generous, and you definitely get value for your money.",

I arrived early, and even though the staff were still getting things ready, they went above and beyond to accommodate me. One particular staff member named Andrew stood out for his exceptional friendliness, articulate communication, and eagerness to assist. The food surpassed my expectations with its superb quality and generous portions. Moreover, the ambiance and overall vibe of the place were truly enjoyable. Definitely coming back!!",

We were there for lunch and service staff Blink was very welcoming and helpful with providing recommendations. For mains, we ordered Com Tam with Pork Ribs and Egg along with the fan-favourite Home Saigon Grilled Chicken with Coconut Rice. They were interesting spins of the traditional versions and the servings were relatively big. The I Love You cocktail was the highlight of our meal! Will definitely be back if we’re around the area!",

I thought the Ribs with egg is a bit salty.\n\nService- very good.\n\nOverall - good but not great. The 4.7 stars on Google suggest this place is near perfect. It is not.

The staff at restaurant are not just friendly and welcoming, they go above and beyond to make your dining experience truly special. And Miss Blink, in particular, is a gem. Her energy and genuine enthusiasm for her work are contagious. She makes you feel like you're dining with a friend rather than a server.\n\nAnd the food, oh my! The flavors and spices of Vietnam come alive in every dish. From the pomelo salad with prawn and pork, to the fried egg noodles with chicken, every bite is an explosion of taste in your mouth. And let's not forget the egg coffee, a Vietnamese delicacy that you won't find just anywhere.\n\nSure, the prices might be on the higher side, but trust me, it's worth every penny. You're not just paying for a meal, you're paying for an experience that will leave you with memories to cherish forever.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a beautiful restaurant with amazing food and an exceptional staff, look no further than HomeHome Saigon restaurant and Bar. And if you're lucky, you might just get to be served by Miss Blink, the star of the show.",

                              "I found this place on Google with good reviews, and it did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious and the smoothie is as good as it gets. Is a small shop, but the decor is cute. The only disappointing thing was that they almost didn’t seat me, they had a large group coming in as part of a food tour. They were going to seat me outside, which was way too hot. Fortunately, there was another fellow solo traveler with me, and together with the two of us, and with a different server, we were seated inside. it’s very reassuring when you find a place that is authentic, but also friendly for foreigners. I think I end up paying around 20 USD, but I did have two of those smoothies. This is well worth a try!",

The food was out of this world! Tasty and succulent beyond belief. The scallop starter and Grouper main were perfection!

Love how every single dish was so rich in flavor and tastes just right. Portions are big enough. The view is to die for. We came for dinner so we didn't get to see the beautiful view during the day. But night time, it was still beautiful.  Service was fast. Definitely coming back.",

Extra mention is the black pepper snails. It's chewy and quite spicy because of the black pepper. I think they are delicious.  The other dishes are good.\nThe room that we're in, was really hot even though there was Aircon.  So, it was a bit uncomfortable.  The coolest place in this premise is the toilet. 😀",

The menu design is striking, offering a wide array of food choices and convenient combo options to cater to various preferences.\n\nHowever, while the menu is enticing, I found the food quality to be just okay. Personally, I didn't perceive the freshness of the ingredients, and the flavors leaned towards being slightly sweet and oily for my taste. Of course, taste preferences can vary greatly from person to person.",

The service is worrisome and does have large room to improve. One reason is that the servants have serious issue with communication in English and also lack effectiveness and patience of explaining the details about the dishes and making some recommendations about their specialties  (given that the customers are unfamiliar with the local food culture). The service ought to live up to the level of the money one spend on a meal in there. To me personally, it deserves one star top.",

The part we were seating literally had no air flow at all in the restaurant. There was only one fan sitting on the floor near the entrance of the room, and the room has 4 long large tables with 5 booth seats which sits 4ppl. We were sweating so much because it was so hot, hardly can breathe while dining. Service was not up to standard, we ordered our drinks and food but waited for more than 15mins before we asked the waitress where is our drinks then she told us they don’t have anymore coconut juice, which she did not attend to us straight after our order. We then had to choose something else. I realised the waitress had not submitted our order to the kitchen until we corrected the drinks! I would not recommend this restaurant at all.",

Yesterday I had one that was much much much better and cheaper.\nVegetable is old. These kind of morning glory is for soup. I love morning glory but don’t order the one from this restaurant it’s the first time I’m upset like this in a restaurant in Vietnam.\nThe place is beautiful. The menu is not very convienent… they end up giving an iPad to order but what you see is not what you get.\nSadly I don’t recommend this place.\nI don’t usually like to leave bad reviews but even the manager wasn’t friendly I guess because it’s a super busy tourist trap.",

Flies were all around too.\n\nShrimp pancake was huge and deep fried. Tried snails with pepper. Also ordered claypot catfish which tasted like salted fish, the dish was so salty we were unable to finish it. Before rice arrived at our table, we felt really full and asked for cancellation instead of wasting rice. Someone took our request, however later on another server came with the rice. Before it was even placed on our table we said we already cancelled, however she insisted \"no cancellation\" and forced us to accept the rice that can feed 3 people. That was just vnd 60k how much can you earn from it that you rather throw the rice away? And obviously rice is mass cooked not specifically cooked for our table we can't comprehend why it is not cancellable.\n\nAbsurd pricing for how the food tastes.\nI don't feel welcomed at all and staffs seem rude. Worst service I've encountered in Vietnam, most Vietnamese people are so kind and warm in other restaurants. Is decent service too much to ask for given that we are paying service charges on top of the food price? Tourists trap.\n\nOh and I realised at the start of my meal there was already sauce at my table which I didn't think of much and actually used it for my food. However by the end of the meal when looking at the other empty tables around none of them has sauce on table ready to be used. Could they have forgotten to clear the previous patron's sauce and I end up eating someone else's saliva? Will never find out, but eww.",

The staff should be more attentive, there were no staff greeting us last time we visited the restaurant. It was also difficult to draw staff's attention when we decided to order. Furthermore, all the cold tea we wanted to order was not available at that time.",

The decor is a stunning mix of vintage bicycles, plates, and ornaments. Diners without reservation are invited to wait in a beautifully decorated area.\n\nThe menu offers a wide variety of delicious and mouthwatering starters and main courses that will appeal to youngsters and adults alike. We had sour soup, prawns, tofu, eggs, salad, and many more. Everything we ate was fresh and delicious\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is brilliant.",

A special thanks to Hien, our waiter (we loved all his stories and recommendations ⚽🇧🇪), the manager, and all the staff who were incredibly kind and attentive. Food was outstanding! We highly recommend the Vietnamese Discovery Tasting Menu – it was absolutely delicious! The cold dessert was a perfect finish to our meal. We can't wait to return!!!",

Food is high quality, served greatly and with nice and original mix of flavors. Wine cart maybe should be updated. Waiters service is what you expect in a place like this, caring, dish explanation and friendly. I had really good time and suggest to try this place if you are in Saigon (I come often to Saigon, but it was first time here). From outside you don't notice the restaurant, as on the ground floor is a club for music and good cocktails. Restaurant is at the first floor after you enter.",

Excellent quality food, a story to accompany each course from the waiters as to the origins of the food and it’s ingredients, and great portion sizes - we were definitely full by the end and given the quantity of the dishes (13 in total) relieved that they were each a little smaller in size! We opted for cocktails to accompany our meal rather than wine as the cocktail menu was extensive, intriguing and reasonably priced. A great atmosphere both in the restaurant and downstairs lounge. What a great way to celebrate our final evening in this vibrant city.",

We ordered the five course and the seven courses menus to get the most variety out of their dishes and we were extremely disappointed by almost every dish. Simply put, the food was terrible but presented as gourmet. Don’t be fooled by the photos. Nothing that we tasted was worth the money nor the visit. The two stars are purely for the friendly service and attentiveness we received.",

Pork belly was the best. Wine option is not worth it, just order a good bottle. Waiter was very friendly. Would just recommend to check your bill, we were overcharged. Menu (with wine) costs 1.700kd (900kd without wine), we were charged 1.900kd per person. Should have complained, but did not notice in time and did not want to make a fuss. And roughly 15% is added on top for tax and service.',

Generally speaking, for anyone who wants a bottle of wine (or equivalent) between two, it is better value is to go for the food-only option and to select your own beverages separately.",

It’s GIGANTIC.\nThe food is no doubt delicious, it’s seasoning is very reasonable and healthy.\nOne particular thing that I like is tables are divided by a partition with little tree on it. It help keep the privacy but bring the green look to the restaurant.\nThe service is warming, not too much of welcoming, which I like. I tend to be scared those places where people grinning too much to customers, almost forcing.\nThis place service is decent and just enough.\n5 stars for the food and the service, i had a good time here with my Mom.",

The roll is bigger compared to other places and there is more filling, lots of pate, sauce, and mayo, which makes it extra tasty. Bread is light and crispy. Eating this is dreamy! Maybe not for you if you don’t like it heavy, rich or quite meaty.\n\nThere’s always a queue here but it moves quickly. If you don’t want to queue in the heat, pay a bit extra and order it on Grab whilst waiting in a cafe with a drink nearby.",

One order comes with a loaded banh mi, wet nap, veggies, and one glove.  This banh mi will fill you as it is loaded with meat and pate.  The veggies provides a good balance to all the meat.  There is no sitting area so I took the banh mi to Nguyen Hue Pho di bo and ate it there.  They also sell you their ingredients so if you like you can make it at home.

They do pack the banh mi with so much meat, but at the detriment of the overall taste. I feel like the pickled veg could’ve been more sour to cut through the richness of all the meat, butter and pate, and the salad could’ve done with more coriander, because there was barely any.",

You need to place your order on one room and then sit down on the other room.\n- You can request the restaurant to cut and divide Banh Mi in half.\n- The portions are very large! It can be shared by 2 people. The bread is extremely crispy, and the filling is packed with plenty of vegetables and meat. It's recommended to eat it with the fresh vegetables provided by the restaurant.\n- The service is excellent, polite, and friendly.",

The establishment provided a delightful overall experience with attentive service and a pleasant ambiance. However, for our specific preferences, we found the banh mi to be overly generous with the meat portion, which overshadowed the delicate balance of flavors we typically enjoy in this dish. While the quality of ingredients and preparation were commendable, the proportion did not align with our expectations. Regrettably, this means we won’t be returning, but we appreciate the effort and quality presented.",

Thankfully the drivers tell us that ‘our’ access is a couple of doors down. Once again, another eatery that has become so popular that they have acquired a second location close by!\nMuch to our relief the queue is only a few deep (even though the first customer is picking up 20 Banh Mi’s!) and we order at the window to our left. The line moves to the right and we wait patiently whilst watching the team at work. This is a well oiled machine and they move through the orders very quickly.\nFinally it’s our turn and the Banh Mi is packed with the ‘fresh’ produce in a separate bag. We’ve not seen or had it this way before but definitely enjoyed building our own!\nOnce completed we could not believe how tasty this was and hands down one of the best in Vietnam! There was so much filling that we shared one between us so bring your appetite!\nWould absolutely recommend!!",

I personally could not finish this in one setting and took the leftovers home.\n\nIt was a little confusing at first when we arrived. There were two lines, one for Grab delivery pick ups and another for customers. You need to purchase a ticket on the far left first before you join the line to pick up your Bánh Mì. Luckily one of their staff stood outside and advised us where to go and what to do when we were displaced.\n\nOnce we picked up our order, the dine in area was completely packed. We went across the street to cafe Lê Gia, where they kindly allowed us to use their space to eat our Bánh Mì after we ordered some drinks.\n\nThe Bánh Mì was delicious. The accompanying herbs and pickled vegetables were packed separately so they could remain fresh if you decided to eat a little later, or in my case, ended up with some leftovers.\n\nWe arrived around 3pm and witnessed long lines. I cannot imagine what it may be like during peak hours!",

                              "(June 2023)\nThis was my second favourite bánh mì in all of Vietnam (the first was Madam Khanh in Hoi An). It’s so different from other sandwiches, it’s very meat-heavy and the main star is the pâté, which is super delicious but very fatty. Pickled vegetables and herbs come in a separate plastic bag, which is not good for someone who cannot handle heat (since everything the chillies touch can turn spicy) 😅 Back in June, it cost 65k VND. The two of us ate one bánh mì (it weighs more than 600g) in a nearby park but there’s a dining area on the right side of the place where you first have to buy it.",

They provide the veggies and garnishes on the side. Definitely one of the best banh mi I've had, of course it is pricey compared to other spots you can find but worth trying.",

                              "probably the biggest (and most expensive) banh mi i had while in vietnam! at 68k, this banh mi comes with vegetables (on the side), a bunch of mixed meat slices, shredded pork, and pate.\n\ni feel like a lot of banh mis in vietnam lacked filling, but to be honest i feel as if huynh hoa almost had too much. there was an insane amount of pate in mine which kind of overpowered the whole banh mi. it's good if you love pate/meat, but the amount of deli meat and pate was really heavy on my stomach. i had to take some of the meat out in order to finish it.\n\nthe banh mi can easily be two portions/shared. it is a good price for what you get though, just maybe not my personal favorite.",

Yes, it is a bit more expensive than the others, but it’s worth the price. I ate it 3 times while I was here. The staff is also super friendly and chatty.

I was really looking forward to trying this place out and had high hopes.\n\nUnfortunately, the Banh Mi was not edible and I just threw the entire thing away after 3 bites.\n\nBecause they are busy, the guys putting the sandwiches together rush through the process and are very sloppy and careless when putting on ingredients such as mayo and pate. This leads to an uneven distribution of ingredients and just a gross tasting sandwich.\n\nThere were also no vegetables in the sandwich, and they included a very tiny amount in a small plastic bag for you to put on yourself.\n\nThen there is the price. I get the banh mi is large, but that isn’t really anything special when you are paying 2x the price of a regular banh mi. 68k VND is ridiculous, but would be justifiable if the sandwich at least tasted good.\n\nI would not recommend anyone come here, this is just a tourist trap.",

You could cut it in half and share it or make sure you come hungry and devour the whole lot! Be prepared for a long queue at peak times.

It used to be just one shoplot for takeaway but now they've expanded , offering dine in facilities. I dined in their smaller shoplot which is quite basic and simple (only to find out they have a larger dine in next door after I finished). The premise is quite clean but the food was as good as I remembered and the price is very good as the portion is huge!!! If you don't fancy queuing up, you can also find them on Grab which just costs a little bit more. Overall, I can't recommend this shop enough and hopefully they will keep up the great work!!! I'm missing this place already as I'm typing this",

You should try their chili oil, it would give a different taste to your noodle soup.\nThe staffs are too casual, they serve us with high pitch tone and send menu orders to the kitchen by shouting from the place they are standing on (near the customers), once we mentioned a menu, they directly shouted to the kitchen staff right away. So a bit of noise actually in the middle of hot weather 😏",

They look fresh and clean . So make u feel eating more\n\nSecond , the meat of a bowl is good. However if we compare to another famous Pho store , its also abit expensive. And it will be expensive when u compare with normal Pho place\n\nThird , their service is still very local way . Even now they has Michellin\n\nLast but not least , they are at central of the city so I also high recommend for everyone about this place",

                              "I had a negative experience with this place on two separate occasions, three days apart, due to severe gastrointestinal issues. After eating lunch there, I experienced diarrhoea for 1.5 day, and after dinner on the second visit, I vomited multiple times. Initially, I didn't suspect this restaurant initally because I had eaten at many places during my trip and it could be anyone of them. Of course if I knew it I wouldn't have returned otherwise, what more took nice photos/videos for my Instagram. However, after the second incident, I knew right away that this place is the problem as the coincidence of my gastrointestinal issues were just few hours after the meal and I did not have the appetite to eat during the day (Read: still suffering a little from the upset stomach 3 days back). I suspected it may have been caused by their vegetables or chilli sauce, but I can't be sure. Therefore, I would advise tourists against visiting this establishment due to the risk of stomach upset from their pho and ruining your holiday.\n\nAdditionally, there were confusing aspects regarding pricing; I was surprised by additional charges such as fried fritters and towels, which I assumed were included with the meal like side vegetables and condiments. While these were minor expenses for me, it's something others should be aware of to avoid any misunderstandings.",

Orders are promptly served, accompanied by a bowl of fresh herbs and an array of condiments and utensils on the side.\n\nThe standout feature here is undoubtedly the delicious pho broth, which impresses with its rich flavor and evident absence of MSG or excessive seasoning. Available in both small and large sizes, the pho is reasonably priced, offering excellent value for money. While not the most economical choice in the area, the quality justifies the price point. Without hesitation, I highly recommend this establishment!",

Prices are good, and the food tastes excellent. You can see the broth making right in the restaurant. All the side dishes are very nice and I again recommend to others to visit this place.\nUnfortunately don't know how is it now in 2022 after Vietnam reopened. Check it out, definitely one of the best PHO I ate in Saigon.",

The fried dough is southern style as it is soft vs the crisp northern style. Skip the spring rolls & if they have meat pies, order them but they seem to be always sold out of them.",

Cofffee sadly is not too strong for my liking but the beef soup helped to compensate for it. There’s also wifi here for free too.

The beef is juicy, tender, and tasty, perfectly mixed with the soup. They give you tons of veggies to mix with the pho. They also served other foods than pho, like spring roll. And i love the sugarcane. It’s mixed with orange and lemon so it tastes really fresh. Btw, the staff can speak English so it really helps alot especially when you’re a tourist.\nOverall i recommend this place!",

                              "A phở place with a long history since 1968. The portion is big and worth the price. The broth is flavourful, and is very typical of Southern style phở. I had a bowl of medium rare beef noodles soup and beef ball. The side herbs are plentiful in terms of amount, with bean sprouts.\nThis place seems to be very popular to tourists and locals. I have seen Korean and Chinese visitors when I visited this place. The beef ball is a bit salty in my personal opinion, but the taste feels good. The medium rare beef is decent, but not impressive. The atmosphere of the location feels very authentic of any local phở place in Ho Chi Minh city, with spacious and clean corners filled with customers. Overall, it’s a place to have a heartful bowl of Vietnamese Southern style phở soup.",

The size is about a medium size you find in western countries, but the soup quality taste a lot better, beefier, and just clean taste.  They have other side dishes for sale but didn’t get this time.  Would come back again",

However, i feel like it didnt reach my expectations.\n\nFood: i order all mix big bow Pho. I feel like only a bow that big, the rest like normal ( noodle, all kinds of beef) Beef also sticky, not tender or juicy. Soup quite ok. A little sweat but acceptable. Also, i order Coconut, taste nice.\n\nService: quick but nothing special.\n\nAtmosphere: 1st floor was very crowded. But they got 2nd floor. Restaurant not that clean but acceptable.",

                              "This is a Michelin-mentioned restaurant. It’s location is like a hidden speakeasy. The main entrance looks like an abandoned outlet but as you go further inside, you’ll see a signage and you have to take the stairs to the upper level to get to the restaurant. This place is very busy so do expect some waiting time if you come during the main meal periods.\n\nThe decoration is simple and modern yet has traditional touches.\n\nThe staff were all friendly and very welcoming.\n\nWe went there at around 8.30pm and almost every item after the next that we wanted to order was sold out or not available. So we ordered the items that we were t really keen on at first. Quite disappointing.\n\nThe food were served quite fast which was unexpected as the place was completely full when we were there. Everything was very tasty and full of flavour. One of the best Vietnamese food we’ve tasted on this 2.5 week trip.",

The Banh Xeo Tom Thit was massive but had more of bean sprouts than pork and shrimp. It was disappointing, we tried this unique dish too which was stuffed squid with minced pork and salted egg sauce and it was abysmal, the worst squid I’ve had during my trip to Vietnam",

There's no elevator. Food portions are smaller, suggest to orders three dishes to share between two people. We enjoyed the tasty dishes, fresh and quickly prepared.

They greeted me with genuine smiles and promptly guided me to my table. Their knowledge and passion for Vietnamese cuisine were evident as they provided insightful recommendations and answered my questions with enthusiasm.\n\nThe menu at Rice Field showcases an impressive array of traditional Vietnamese dishes, each with its own distinct flavors and aromas. I opted for the crab soup, vegetables and The fresh spring rolls, which were bursting with vibrant colors and textures. The combination of fresh herbs, crisp vegetables, and succulent shrimp, wrapped in delicate rice paper, provided a refreshing and light appetizer. It was evident that the ingredients were of the highest quality, and the attention to detail in the preparation was commendable.\n\nThe ambiance at Rice Field further enhanced my dining experience. The restaurant is tastefully decorated with a rustic charm, exuding a sense of tranquility amidst the bustling city. Soft lighting, comfortable seating, and soothing Vietnamese music created a serene environment that allowed me to relax and savor my meal. The restaurant is on the second floor, which is undergoing renovation on the first floor right now so don't be alarm.\n\nThe service throughout my visit was impeccable.

Brought a bottle of wine and paid corkage, but imagine drinking that in a sauna. That is exactly the situation. Food was incredibly bland although it was presented nicely. Beef skewers were so hard i thought it was tripled cooked. Would advise never ever going here.",

The food is delicious (try the truffle burger!) and the cocktails choice is very interesting- we liked everything we tried! The manager (a French guy, unfortunately we didn’t get the name) is so cool - he finds time to chat with every visitor, super amiable. Hello from the Russian couple, hope we see you again!",

A was welcomed by a staff member, seated at a more ventilated place, and advised on cocktails and food.\nThe sunset was beautiful and the view was spectacular. The atmosphere felt a little tense at first, as I believe some sort of manager was visiting. A very grumpy individual who didn't feel the necessity to say hello even when making eye contact with customers...shy or just  arrogant? Who knows?\nWhen he finally left, the tension was gone, and some life came back to the staff who were actually more relaxed, wore a broader smile and were far more efficient as a team.\n\nThe staff are attentive, kind, professional and well organized on a busy ladies' night event.\nThe food was decent, the cocktails were tasty and elegant, the music was nice too.\n\nSaigonese parties can be a little soulless but that's another debate.",

I would recommend eating before going or having plans for after.",

Their naughty fries is just normal fries with some cheese and bacon bits sprinkled on top. The seating is uncomfortable and the music is too boring. Not worth the value.",

We ordered 4 different cocktails and all of them were top notch 👌. The burger Le Smash is just perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The falafel burger is also very delicious if you prefer vegetarian. The staff is super friendly. Overall, this place is a must when you visit HCM city.",

The drinks are delicious and the roof top atmosphere is spot on. Since a lot of expats come here, expect a welcoming staff that speaks fluent english.\n\nThe vibe is very relaxing and you can actually hear the people you're with speak. I highly recommend coming here to escape from the busy places in Saigon. It's a little escape and don't be surprised if you feel like you're not even in Saigon for the moment!",

View and setting, perfect!\nWe were super disappointed we didn’t get the chance to make it back here before leaving.\nThe European waiter, blonde with glasses - super cool and chill, took the orders, efficient and quick, small chit chat and left us alone - exactly what we expect.\nHowever, Tippy - super annoying. Stayed at our table asking too many questions, then pausing awkwardly, waiting for us to carry the conversation. We initially thought he was trying to be nice, but it was hard work for us. Im on holiday, I want to relax with my partner, quietly, not interview a waiter on his life plans. Then it became clear. Tippy asked us to write a 5 star review on trip advisor, told us to mention his name, spelled it out, then reminded us THREE more times to review HIM before we left. He was 1-star. Everything else, 5-star. Also he shoved his little finger up his nose no less than 3 times while chatting with us… gross. He should focus more on serving customers and doing his job, instead of sweet talking for trip advisor reviews.",

Great view, even better music from the live spin DJ. Try their cocktails, and the Dirty Fries - great food and great fun. Card machine was down when we were there, so only cash. Service was friendly, but the place was really crowded so you might have to stand for a while before they can get you a seat.",

We were much please by the food quality at VK, less varieties than Saigon Cafe but quality is perfect\nUsually at any buffet the oyster would give you a good indication how fresh food are, then come to other type of seashells and Japanese raw fish (sashimi)\nAt VK oysters were very fresh, probably because it was Saturday, people said oysters from others countries fly in on Friday (?)\nSeashells are fresh and tasty same as sashimi\nPrice is slightly lower than Saigon Cafe but we love the quality\nThe quality of the staff too, including kitchen staff, extremely nice and very helpfull, 5 stars staff\nRecommended for Saturday dining, other days we have not tried yet",

I really enjoyed how the restaurant was able to offer a variety of delicious options ranging from various cuisines that was perfect for the different preferences of each family member. Personally, I enjoyed the local Vietnamese soups and small bites they would offer each morning!\n\nAnother notable aspect of this restaurant was the staff and service. Everyone was attentive and welcoming to ensure a nice, positive atmosphere. Specifically, I would like to distinguish Phat for not just his amazing coffee making skills but also for his phenomenal, hard work. He made the start of each and every morning of our week stay so memorable and wonderful, kick starting it with some of the best Vietnamese coffee I’ve had to date. He is so genuine and his bright energy and big smile was near contagious, brightening the mood and start of the day for all!\n\nOverall the combination of the highest quality service and food made the stay so enjoyable! Would definitely recommend not just the restaurant but also the hotel in itself for an unforgettable experience in Ho Chi Minh City!",

The dishes were perfectly balanced on all aspects – flavour, texture and the right combination of Vietnamese and French influence.\n\nThe only minor disappointment was the fact that their signature fish dish (Snow Fish) is imported from Norway (as I prefer local produce when travelling) and tasted fishy without soy sauce. However, it had a nice flaky texture and was complimented well by the side vegetables.\n\nOverall verdict: I would recommend for all high-end food lovers to put this place on top of their ‘must eat’ list in Ho Chi Minh.",

Service: staff is nice (but smile and say hi is not enough with me, they so slow and not focus,not professional. I am really surprised and dont know how this restaurant training their staffs\n2. I ordered\n1. Mille-Feuille Crab Salad: this was so good and I like it\n2. Seabass and their meat still pink color. When I complain about it they answer me because they cook slow- cook to try to keep water for meat. I agree but I wanna know why meat still have pink. (and the way staff answers me make me really uncomfortable because I don't feel they really listen my question. And trying to explain for me what I dont know . I am sure they still don't understand how is slow cook )\n3. Desserts for free : greentea cake is my first choice and that is last one too when taste too bad. Like taste inside fridge After everything I dont think to complain to when we pay the bill My and my friend gave them 2 credit cards. And staff really dont understand why we give 2 cards. I can see they confuse Btw I hope Ly Club Saigon have to train their staffs again",

I appreciated the thoughtful progression of each course, which provided a complete and wholesome flavor experience.\nThe service was the highlight for me. The staff's elegance and attention to detail were exceptional. The restaurant manager, our table friend Tam, and even the executive chef frequently visited to ensure we had the best time, carefully explaining and showcasing the art of culinary right before our eyes.\nThank you, Truffle team, for today's dinner.",

Foods serve very slow, maybe it’s not my taste because mostly everything is a bitter for me, very very small dish.\nStaffs always surrounding us, we need more private space. Someone played the saxophone at first, then the space became quiet after that. Insane prices (maybe about location fees). We ordered set menu for each person, we only drank WATER, nothing else. Each person cost more than 9,000,000VND+ . It’s not worth that price.\nWe couldn’t get full, after that we went out to eat a bowl of noodles.",

Perfect spot for a date night or a night out with friends. We both opted for set menus. I asked if I could substitute out a pork dish that was on one of the menus, and they happily obliged. I got the "mushroom scallops" instead and let me tell you, it was not a mistake! The texture and taste was similar to the real thing. I was very impressed. We went on a Friday night and they had a saxophone player start playing music in the middle of the dining room. This was definitely a nice touch. The food came out in a timely manner and the wine selection was superb as well. The price point was very affordable given the quality of the food AND the prime location in District 1. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an affordable yet fancy night out.',

The lunch set doesn't make me feel good enough for the price. We chose Home set pax (as I remember it around 350k), the only set served for lunch. The starter and dessert are good. But the main course is just a dish with fish, maybe as our tradition, we eat it with rice or something like that.\n\nI will come back if I have a chance and choose the salmon one. It's looking good through the review.",

The dishes were prepared with inspiration from traditional Vietnamese dishes like Canh Chua and Sủi Dìn but with a modern twist, and they were truly delicious. However, the waiter didn't inform us in advance that the grill wouldn't be operating during lunchtime. We had to select another dish after waiting for 10 minutes, which was a bit frustrating.

First, BOM has their signature decoration, the restaurant is classic, pretty, and traditional by its decoration. Second, I was impressed by the outstanding customer service here. The servers are knowledgable about the menu, wine list, and how to pair food with wine. Everything we ordered were amazing, some will be my favorites, and I’ll list my points below:\n• Crispy Clam Bites: 5/5 ⭐️\n• Tuna Tataki: 5/5 ⭐️\n• “Tôm Rim” Spaghetti: 4.5/5 ⭐️ I just don’t like the peanut to go with this dish.\n• Kumquat Pork: 5/5 ⭐️ The most delicious one! The amazing combination of grilled pork and kumquat sauce. It reminds me of the very signature dish of Vietnam - “cơm tấm” broken rice for breakfast.\n• Crab Fried Rice: 5/5 ⭐️ The soft shell crab is a great choice for this 👏🏻\n• Mustard Leaves Wrapped Kanpachi: 4/5 ⭐️ Need more flavors in the sauce!\n• Pepper Steak (350g): 3/5 ⭐️ I tried steak at many other places and this one couldn’t satisfy my taste. The beef was a little bit chewy, the seasoning was normal, and the pumpkin to go with was so creamy for me. Maybe this not my type!\n• Yuzu Brownie: 5/5 ⭐️ The sourness from yuzu, the bitterness from brownie, and the sweetness from vanilla ice cream just blended together 🥰\n• Vanilla & Strawberry Ice Cream: 5/5 ⭐️\n\nOverall, this is one of the best choices for fine dining with the affordable price!",

The food surpassed expectations with its top-notch quality, and the drinks were equally impressive. The atmosphere exuded coziness and relaxation, making it the perfect setting for a special occasion. What truly stood out was the attentive service—the staff accommodated our special requests with grace and even surprised us with a complimentary dessert cake to mark the celebration. Overall, they exceeded all expectations, providing a memorable dining experience that I won't soon forget.",

I do not want to have to deal with this kind of experience.\nI will probably give this restaurant another chance, because everything else was really great: Beautiful, tasty dishes with varied flavors and textures. Excellent, fast and friendly service by well-trained staff. Very good wine list (by the glass, and bottles) and cocktails. The interior design was outstanding, with it's massive brass disc on the wall, surrounded by a huge wine shelf, an avangardistic plant-like sculpture suspended from the ceiling, and the narrative focus on the cute little Vietnamese folklore character of Bờm with leave-like fans scattered around the tasteful dining room.\nBUT: I do NOT want to bump into a rat at my place of dining. It's disgusting. I hope management will draw the right conclusions from this review and take up measures so that something like this will not happen again. Set up traps, install a front door that has no crack at the bottom so rats can't squeeze through and keep it closed at all times (inexplicably the restaurant doesn't seem to have a front door if my memory serves me right), seal cracks where rats can slip through etc. Me giving a 3-star review despite this nasty incident shows you that I genuinely like this restaurant, and I wish it to succeed. But I will not tolerate something like this a second time!",

The storefront is just a door that looks very unassuming but when you go inside and walk upstairs, you’re greeted with a very modern, and ambient environment.\n\nFood wise, everything was delicious. Oysters for appetizer were fresh and creamy (sounds weird but trust they’re delicious). I had the flank steak for my main course and the meat was seasoned well with a tasty collection of sauces. The fries that came with it were also cooked with a truffle oil it seemed like—a nice touch.\n\nI would recommend checking this place out if you’re craving an upscale Latin restaurant in the heart of Saigon.",

The crispy potatoes was the BEST POTATOES we have ever had!!! ❤️ Drink was good too.\n\nService was excellent, kudos to BER, he is awesome, always have the lovely smile on his face. That definitely another highlight of the night. ❤️\n\nBut the downside was, wrong choice of music for the environment, it was too noisy and way too loud. We have to literally scream to each other to have a conversation. And because of the loud music, every guests have to do the same as us, screaming to each other. End up the whole restaurant became like a market. Which force us to leave right away after the dinner. ☹️☹️☹️\n\nWe will definitely come back again if we ever going to visit HCM. But hopefully with a better choices of songs.",

Every main course was served with either Mexican or coriander rice, and tortillas which added to the taste. pro tip: order the carne asada steak, wrap it in a tortilla with Mexican rice, drench it with chimichuri, and enjoy! Not to mention, the peri peri chicken was falling off the bone. The juiciness of the chicken left us utterly amazed.\n\nThe service was top notch, as expected from a Michelin recommended restaurant. Our waitress had heard me comment that I liked sour drinks, and as it was my birthday, she brought us a round of sour soju and tea shots! On the house! It was such a nice gesture and made my birthday even more special. The head chef talked to us a few times, and offered us a free desert! 10/10 service, could not have asked for better\n\nAtmosphere was filled with good Latino and American music, DELICIOUS drinks (try the red sangria) and overall very nice decor.\n\nI would 100% recommend this resturant to anyone wanting to celebrate a special moment, or simply looking for a restaurant that combines good food and good atmosphere.",

Another thing we appreciated was the “on the house” creme brulee cheesecake and 4 shots - as one of us is celebrating her birthday. It was unexpected as I only mentioned it while we were taking tons of photos wherein they were also very supportive. When we asked for the bill, they sang and served us free dessert and shots. Thank you to the Sol Team. You made our night special.",

There wasn't a crowd so I was able to have a good quiet lunch with my wife.\n\nQuality of food...I saw a Michelin sign and raised my expectations. The price of food here is higher than normal so expectations was raised further. In the end.. the food is just good, not great.\n\nGo for the set lunch for good value for money.",

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were captivated by its stunning design and welcoming ambiance. The decor was exquisite, blending traditional elements with modern flair, creating an unforgettable atmosphere. The staff were incredibly friendly, adding to the warmth of the place. As we settled in, we were greeted with a refreshing welcome drink, setting the tone for an exceptional evening. And the food? Simply divine. Each dish was a masterpiece, bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. Our first dinner in Ho Chi Minh City was nothing short of spectacular.",

After a short struggle to find out the restaurant is around the corner from the location in Google Maps, we were greeted by a hostess on the ground floor. Tip:  walk around the corner from the beer bar and it’s immediately on the right.\n\nCocktails were bursting with fresh juices. We each had 2-3 each. Order an app, and several items to share family style for the 3 of us. Incredible that this tiny service area includes both kitchen and bar!\n\nPeri Peri chicken was the highlight for me personally. The ribs were dynamite too (I’m definitely going to try replicating these ribs at home). Notice that some items are cooked over live fire too!\n\n2 of the items we ordered came with different rice, and to our surprise, staff came around and offered to replenish each of them.  Staffed in general was extremely pleasant and ready to serve. We had at least 3 different people come check on us.\n\nWas seriously impressed with this place.  Had given the Latino-looking chef our complements on the way outmoded only regret is not having other people with us to order more food and be able to sample more of the menu.",

The highlight for me was definitely the pho!! it was amazing and a perfect way to kick off the morning.\n\nThe restaurant has a nice river view, though it's on a lower floor, so the view isn’t as striking as the one from the lounge. Still, it’s a lovely spot to enjoy a relaxed breakfast. Overall, a solid choice if you’re staying at the hotel.",

Staffs are very nice and helpful with smiles on their faces and keeping up nicely with their tasks.  For the price point between $40-$50/person, this really is worth the price, I admit I did expect a bit more in term of food options, fewer choice than anticipated; but with what they presented, they did a very decent job.  Food are fresh and kept warm, quickly refilled.  Overall it was a great experience for myself and my family!",

The burger was cooked to absolute perfection, featuring a myriad of extremely fresh ingredients such as a beef patty, bun, cheese, onion, egg, and mushrooms, all grilled to sublime perfection. The aromatic interplay between the cheese and beef was beautifully complemented by the pleasant crunch of onions and mushrooms. Adding to the experience were the thick fries, impeccably grilled and unsalted, served with a delectable cheese sauce on the side. A truly delicious meal!"',

This place may provide different flavor for tourist but not for me.\nI have been to Nha Trang so many times and eat at so many places and other provinces in the central part of Vietnam but the flavor there somehow is different and more tasty.\nThe weak point here is the sauces, so salty. In Vietnam Cuisine, your sauces fail so your dishes is not good overall .\nThe price are expensive compared with the quantity and the quality of foods. There are some dishes that are so normal and I forget to take picture of them.\nThe atmosphere is not something special here. It looks clean and that’s all. The staff is ok.\nI myself do not think this place can be a good place to give you good food of Nha Trang. There are a lot of good places for you to eat with more original flavor and super delicious sauces.",

The waitor of our table is friendly and helpful. It was busy at that time so they do forget to serve some of what we order extra. The food tastes good, especially the fried rice with anchovies (very delicious). They sell some of the ingredients that they use in their menu, you can see at the entrance to buy. I forgot to take a pic of the hot pot at the end. The prices are quite high but once in a while to have a meal here is not a big deal. It's a must-try restaurant :)",

The portion is just perfect, you feel just enough before dessert. We didn’t like their desserts on summer menu. But this season, all desserts are well made. Definitely will come back. However, they can improve their “celebration dish”. Didn’t expect to receive a half lemon with a candle on that while I already told them in advance that we will celebrate birthday. So minus 0.5 star for that ;)",

The restaurant is luxurious with an open kitchen on the 1st floor and a dining area on the 2nd floor. The lighting and music are just right, helping customers to fully focus on the food. The menu has a lot of dishes, so remember not to eat too much that day, otherwise you will be too full. The staff are kind and quick. When a new dish is brought out, the staff will explain about that dish, including the ingredients, how to eat it... The dishes are very elaborately decorated, extremely beautiful, and the taste is wonderful. On the 3rd time here, the restaurant offers a menu that combines Western cuisine with Vietnamese cuisine, honoring ingredients and spices from many regions across Vietnam. Honestly, I really like the menu of the 2 previous times more. However, it is still a memorable experience. I look forward to the opportunity to come back and experience the restaurant's new menu.",

The staff were outstanding—friendly, knowledgeable, and professional, adding to the overall excellence of the evening.\n\nThe restaurant absolutely deserves its 5-star rating and place among Asia's Best 100 Restaurants. While the meal was generally superb, we did feel that the temperature on the second floor could be improved, as it tends to get warm, likely due to its position above the kitchen. Turning up the AC slightly would enhance the comfort of the dining area.\n\nAs for the food, the tasting menu was an incredible journey of flavors, though the pork dish didn't quite reach the same level as the other outstanding courses. That said, we'll definitely be coming back for another visit soon!",

After a couple of times visiting both TUNG Dining (when it first opened) and Å by TUNG, I’m once again totally in awe of what he and his team have been doing and bringing to the table. Some of my fave dishes from his current menu Brave to Bloom at Å by TUNG (will be changed to the summer menu soon): carabineros combined with pineapple and cumin, Phở without noodle with a tremendous umami flavour from mushroom & foie gras, the refreshing morning glory with sweet tender toothfish, the super fluffy airy black garlic bread served with tangy kimchi butter and subtle Gia Lai ants, and of course the bloody tasty crème brûlée made with Đà Lạt sweet potato and brown butter mousse which hits all the different levels of sweetness.

                              "A by TUNG is a standout restaurant that offers a unique dining experience. With a stylish kitchen entrance leading to a Nordic-minimalist dining area, it sets the stage for a 20-course tasting menu celebrating Northern European cuisine. Each dish is beautifully presented and bursting with flavour, from bold seafood to delicate combinations, ending with a perfect dessert.\n\nTo top off the whole experience, at the end of the meal, they hand you these chic little cards detailing everything you've just eaten. It's a neat touch that lets you compare notes with your dining partners, letting you relive the whole culinary adventure all over again. Thank you team!",

                              "An Evening at Å by TUNG: A Culinary Delight in Ho Chi Minh\n\nLast night, I had the pleasure of dining at Å by TUNG, and it was an experience that tantalized the senses. For the first time, I stepped into this establishment and was greeted by an ambiance that promised an evening of fine dining. The menu was a canvas of creativity, each dish artfully styled and presented with a modern twist.\n\nThe beef was a standout, its preparation a testament to the chef’s expertise, while the pigeon was presented with a flair that only added to its exquisite taste. The starters were a parade of visual and gastronomic beauty, setting the stage for what was an exceptional culinary journey.\n\nOpting out of the wine pairing, I found the red and white wine selections to be robust and well-curated, complementing the meal beautifully. Each course was served with perfect timing and portioned just right, leaving me satisfied yet eagerly anticipating the next.\n\nThe staff deserves special mention for their attentive service, ensuring that every aspect of the dining experience was seamless. It is this level of care that can elevate a meal into a memorable occasion.\n\nÅ by TUNG is not just a restaurant; it’s a destination for those who appreciate the finer nuances of culinary excellence. Whether it’s already a beacon for gourmands in Ho Chi Minh or on its way to becoming one, it has certainly earned a place of distinction.\n\nI foresee many more evenings spent here, savoring the creativity and indulging in the flavors that Å by TUNG so masterfully presents.",

                              "Probably the worst restaurant in HCM even in comparison with some street side restaurants.\n\nThe worst dishes:\n1) Prawn that is butchered with cheese and gimmick of liquid nitrogen\n2) Guava dish that could have been simple and great was again butchered by thick gelatine for no good reason\n3) Scallop also butchered with bad cooking\n4) Eel was overcooked. Such a pity\n5) Most protein except the pork were not well done\n\nGreat stuff:\nThe sweet potato dessert was really good. Texture was amazing with multiple layers of depth\n\nActually felt like puking throughout the meal (and kinda did once). I need a pill and digestive after. I think now that I read comments from the other reviews (that are not marketing from this shop), it’s true that people felt that this is not fine dining but some guy trying to pull wool over others eyes with some fancy small portions and plates that did not taste anywhere good.\n\nEdit:\nJust looking at the responses from the restaurant and you’ll know they will never improve. If someone says they are bad, it’s always pointing fingers (as per the other feedbacks as well). Actually we have even feedback DURING the session. So don’t come back and say “I don’t know what your intent is”. I paid full price for a sub par meal so yes, we have the rights to feedback. The worst kind of restaurants are these that just think everyone else is at fault. Taste is subjective but balance and techniques are not. Please wake up your idea.\n\nAlso, please don’t say you are doing juice pairing when there is no synergies or thoughts behind the pairing. It’s just selling juice because you can. With your response, I am now VERY sure you’re the worst restaurant I’ve ever been.",

Every detail, from how they escorted me to my table to the meticulous service throughout each course, was thoughtfully executed. The staff, all fluent in English, ensured I understood every dish, even providing informative cards for each plate. With approximately 18 courses, I opted for juice pairings, a refreshing departure from traditional alcohol pairings. Each dish was a work of art, with standout favorites including the Wagyu steak, the cod, the chorizo and surprisingly, the sourdough bread. Not to mention, the desserts were divine. If I ever find myself back in Saigon, this will undoubtedly be my first stop. I'm already considering a visit to their restaurant in Hanoi. An unforgettable dining experience indeed!",

The wine pairing was a letdown apart from the Austrian riesling, but the food was surprisingly good. My favorites were the oyster dish and the salted caramel dish. When they say it’s a 20 course tasting menu, don’t they mean 20 separate courses, but some courses involve three dishes and count as three. Average quality of the dishes was very high and I think it outperforms Esta. Staff appropriately enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Decor I thought was all over the place but there is one good painting near the restroom.",

Every grain perfectly cooked and nice crispiness at the edges! One comment for possible improvement would be to use more local ingredients as reliance on imported ingredients such as wagyu makes the restaurant similar to many other international restaurants but not necessarily celebrating the riches of Vietnam.",

                              "Visited in Mar 2024\n\nThe meal was an 18 course menu which has been very well thought out in terms of flavour profile, ingredients, presentation style, and quantity. My favourite courses were the Ambarella (starter), the Guava Hamachi (starter), the Chorizo Amaebi (main course), the Laksa Cuttlefish (main course), and the Sweet Potato (dessert). With every course you are also presented with a small card explaining the favour profile of the ingredients and the area of Vietnam it is sourced from. This was a very nice touch to the overall experience as you really get to know the culinary inspiration behind the dish.\n\nFor drinks, I went with the juice pairing which has 5 drinks in total (comprised of kombuchas and ciders). While a couple of kombuchas were nice, overall I found the juice pairing to be average as per my taste. Also the pour sizes are a bit too little to pair one drink with 3 courses.\n\nService was top notch. The restaurant was kind enough to cater to my allergies by replacing a couple of dishes.\n\nAll in all, A By TUNG is one of the best fine dining restaurants I’ve been to in HCM and would 100% recommend it to HCM visitors and residents.",

This chef learned his skills in various European restaurants before returning to Saigon and blending it with the Vietnamese cuisine. He has true skill in lifting flavours to the next level. Incredibly impressive experience in terms of food taste and quality. Probably a matter of time before this chef gets a Michelin star.\nNice little touch is that with every dish you get a couple of small cards that explain an interesting fact about some of the ingredients. This is something you can take home as a nice memory. Slight remark: it’s quite expensive, even in comparison to European prices.",

We loved the refined flavours and the seasoning was on-point - not overly salty/sweet as most local dishes tend to be. Service was impeccable and we had a good time interacting with the staff and chef. Definitely my go-to place for my overseas visitors in the future!",

The spring rolls are the best I’ve ever had – crispy, fresh, and bursting with flavor. The seabass is a must-try, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The chicken is incredibly juicy and tender, making it a standout dish. The service is top-notch, with the staff always going above and beyond to serve you in the best way possible. The atmosphere is wonderful, providing a perfect setting for a memorable dining experience. Highly recommended!",

The head chef came out and asked us about our food and described what was used in the food and such. The service was good however at one point we ordered Bone Marrow Pho and when the order came, we saw that there was no bone marrow, so we asked them what happened and they said they ran out of bone marrow. They should have informed us that they had ran out of bone marrow instead of giving us plain Pho, we ordered the bone marrow pho for the bone marrow!! We wanted to try something different, not just plain Pho!! In addition, this is more related to the food, but we ordered the seafood fried rice which contained shrimps but the shrimps did not taste fresh.",

                              "During our short stay in Thao Dien we enjoyed four meals at Madam Lam. As much as we have eaten around at other local restaurants I can say with certainty this is by far the best experience.\n\nFood - cooked to perfection. Vietnamese with a slight fusion twist resulted in flavors familiar but also as I’ve never experienced. Try the Bo Luc Lac you won’t regret it! The Chef is amazing and an amazing guy. He came to the table multiple times to check on us and chat about the menu. The food is 10/10!\n\nService - Like the luxury hotel with the same owners in An Phu, the service is absolutely top-notch. My wife wiped her brow and the chef came out and turned up the AC. She pulled her hair back and the waiter brought a tray with hair ties. They don’t miss anything! 10/10\n\nAmbience - Perfect setting! Clean and very Indochine fashionable. Again, like the hotel everything Madam Làm touches seems to just one perfect. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, you can eat all three here. 10/10\n\nValue - absolutely affordable and lower than comparable spots by a long ways. The final bill will shock you in a positive way. For example, we had three people for lunch. Appetizers, main courses, drinks (non alcoholic), and desert. The price was lower than a similar establishment we dined the prior evening only we had two people, one appetizer, one main course each, no drinks for that meal. Huge bang for your buck! 10/10\n\nIn closingx, out this spot on your list and don’t miss it if you can help it. If you want to double your pleasure book a stay at Mia Saigon and enjoy!",

Luckily they managed to arrange a table for us despite no reservation was made. Their services are definitely 5-star (worthy a Michelin one star, although they haven’t got it yet).

We have ordered diced beef with mangos, dragon bean, stewed chicken with lotus soup, fish with vegetables(I don’t remember its name) and bird nest with tropical fruits as a desert. They were all delicious and the service was great with friendly staff.",

                              "This is my favorite restaurant to visit with a family. The front of the house is very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good suggestions. We felt very welcome and not rushed. The seating was far away enough from the other seats so it is comfortable having a conversation.\n\nWhen the food arrived I was most impressed by their ability to execute the dishes. For instance, the spring roll was not anything I haven't eaten before so the ingredients itself was not a out of the normal, however all you need to do is take a bite and you will understand what really sets this restaurant apart. The spring roll was hot and crispy. Even after letting it sit at the table, it didn't become oily.  The flavors were not surprising but everything was cooked expertly. We loved the banana and roasted peanut popsicle for desert. This place is highly recommended.\n\nVisit: 1",

I chose a few dishes with seafood using different cooking method, steamed, deep fried, or spring rolls with clam meat etc.  they all came out quite amazing, especially with dressing presented. We also ordered Dragonfruit salad (pomelo and shrimp inside) as an appetiser which to me the flavour is very creative yet delicious. Dessert coconut icecream (and thanks to some additional complementary dessert and tea) are also tasty.\nLiked the small serving so we can actually try a few more dishes but overall end up really full and satisfied.\nService is really good, our waitress pays attention to all details, and acts with caring and efficient manners.\nI’d definitely recommend. Plus they have a good range of dishes. Would love to try some other dishes in future.\nPrice wise, I think it’s well worthy. I’m glad we came here, instead of other more pricy fine dining plans.",

It offers a modern twist to traditional Vietnamese dishes, gaining popularity among foreigners as well.\n\nTaste is subjective, and in my experience, the flavors were average, but the blend of Vietnamese culinary traditions with contemporary styles was intriguing. However, it’s worth noting that the prices here are on the higher side, so keep that in mind before visiting.\n\nThe service from the staff was impressive, providing friendly and professional service, enhancing the dining experience. The restaurant’s interior also strikes a unique balance between modern design and Vietnamese traditional elements.\n\nMadame Lam is popular among the expats in Thao Dien and is recommended for those wanting to experience modern Vietnamese cuisine. Just be mindful of the higher pricing when planning your visit.",

Only soup and dry beef noodles were available. Not even a single spring roll.  What a waste of time.\n\nI had the soup noodles. Soup was flavourful but the portion was small and cuts of beef were mediocre. Very disappointing and I couldn’t wait to leave.\n\nThe outdoor seats were also infested with mosquitoes which were a nuisance. The washroom had a very bad stench.\n\nService was cold but the restaurant was well furnished.",

Staying at Masteri, Madame Lam was an easy walk.\n\nAs we approached the quint entrance, we asked for help to find Madame Lam as there are multiple restaurants. We thought this had a nice ambiance and yes, it looks expensive, which it is for Vietnam but thought the price was reasonable for the quality.\n\nWe loved all the dishes we ordered except the sea bass. Not sure if translated wrong but not used to this type. Overall still good, but had expected a different fish. Love the banh canh, fresh noodle and with deep fried soft shell crab. Broth was clear answer little sweet, with crab aroma. Not the classic version but thought well executed. The dragon fruit salad, wow! Also love the clam salad. Not ‘fishy’ or funky, just clean and peanutty and tasty with the crispy rice cake. The drinks and  dessert were okay, had better. Again, overall reasonable for the quality and service!",

For mains we ordered the duck which was cooked phenomenally with crispy skin and the chicken cooked in bamboo which was slightly underwhelming but still tasty. The complimentary starter and dessert were also a great touch! Highly recommend the oysters and duck here!",

Selected Michelin signage at the entrance.\n\nFood is fantastic. You can feel all the flavors in one dish. They put both their skill and heart in the food. The waitress introduced the food well.\n\nRecommend to try Crab with sea urchin and caviar, and Banh Xeo. The complimentary snack was a wow to me. The mockails are fresh and flavorful.\n\nWould love to come back again soon.",

We were very impressed with the enchanting visuals and superb quality of each dish.\nThings which could have been improved: We wish that it’s not mandatory to have a drinks pairing with the set menu, as we prefer to pick our own drinks; and the wine options for wine by glass could be improved.\nKudos to the young and creative team behind Tre Dining!",

There is absolutely nothing that anyone could complain about as literally every single detail is perfect. Profesional service with good manners but not too polite, always willing to explain but not bombarding you with name of every ingredient. Young but talented team with bold yet supple Chef who’s eager to talk with you and take under consideration your preferences. And last but not least, the food. All five flavours are well balanced. High quality freshly sourced local ingredients, prepared and cook to the perfection.\nTeal, lamb chop, tiger prawn and broccoli provide significant umami explosion while other dishes such crab, sea urchin, grouper and sturgeon are milder.\nI spend 5 long weeks discovering cuisine in all over Vietnam but succeeded to find only 3 such excellent venues and this is one of them.",

Some of the gimmicks had zero relevance to the ingredients of the dishes themselves! It's all for... shallow theatrics.\nAnd oh gosh, the waitress. She just could not stop interrupting us. Clearly saw us deep in conversation and nope, that should not matter. Just barged in and demanded us to listen to her narrative about yet another gimmicky dish.\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was her scolding us for accidentally digging up the marshmallows under the cacao powder and... how dare us eating them before her signal! \"You ruined my story!\" (Hai anh làm em gãy quá)\nGosh, this legendary waitress. The manager came out to *apologize* and not even an ounce of genuine of authenticity.\nDid I mention the absolutely boring dishes?\nAt least I have memorable story out of this pretentious experience.",

Services are wonderful though, the restaurant is small but has good atmosphere. I still give the restaurant 5 stars because others seem to enjoy the food here so maybe my taste is just not right that day.",

Even went that little further and brought out a celebration cake for our last night in Saigon.  Really good night.  Do the matching drinks, too",

Waiting staff just standing in the corner playing on their phones in front of their management. They sent the trainee  to serve me when I'm the only person dining. I ordered three items and water. I asked for extra ice, did not come with extra ice or a coaster until they noticed 10 minutes later. I ordered the bread with 3 butters, when coming out they didn't toast the bread properly and forgot the butter. They took it back and brought it back out 10 minutes later after I had finished my main dish.\nI'm very glad I didn't bring a guest with me.\n\nI would only recommend this place if you want pretty decor and dishes.\n\nStill have a long way for anything related to Michelin.",

I loved the ambience so much (we were seated outdoors)!\n\nWe went for their set menu with non alcoholic drink pairing which consisted of a series of dishes following a story of death and rebirth. On this story telling portion - I felt it was lacking flow with the food served halfway through hence it became a little of a drag to have to listen to the story and try to find connection with the food.\n\nOn the food side, it was delicious and I would say adventurous for me to say the least as the ingredients used are out of the norm such that I wouldn’t opt to eat , but the whole experience wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t and it wouldn’t be fair to judge then. Hence it was quite exciting to taste! It was also my first food pairing experience and I’m pleasantly pleased we went for that option!\n\nThe service was on point with super attentive service staff and it made us feel super welcomed and taken care of! Kudos to the team!",

They let us out Chief Keef and whatever obscure Spotify playlist my friend Nick has.\n\nOne of the staff members even offered us her own liquor she brews! We even got a rice patty plant to go. Unfortunately, we lost it on the grab ride back.\n\nWe had a great time conversating and learning more about Vietnam and the staff.\n\nQuite a great night. Service was amazing.",

Everything was well-seasoned, lots of creativity, and my favorite was definitely the Seafood Banh Goi!\n\nThe overall experience was exceptional, we’d love to be back and try the Chef’s Table when we have a chance.

                              'The first thing An\'s noticed us before the service was that they didn\'t call themselves "fine dining". And that statement stayed true throughout the dinner. The tasting menu started with 4 "Viet modern" small dishes, then went to a "mam com" - the word that describes how a typical family meal is supposed to be in Vietnam (various dishes served at the same time, along with steamed rice). Then the dinner finished with 3 other "Viet modern" desserts.\n\nThat combination created an exciting experience for both Vietnamese and foreign eaters that sat that night. We were explained by the Chef about how each dish was crafted, and there was interacting activities that help engaged guests with the restaurant.\n\nOverall that was an interesting enough experience that I will remember, can tell again and again and strongly recommend everyone to try themselves at least once.\n\nI\'ll come back soon for their a la carte menu.',

I also love the salad here as you can taste how fresh it is and it complements well with other dishes too.\nFor dinner, they have chef course, which is a totally different setting and atmosphere, where you sit in a room with chef serving dishes and explaining the meaning of the dish, the inspiration and the origin of the ingredients. I can’t explain well with words and it’s something you can only feel when you experience it. It will worth every penny of yours. In addition you need to book in advance for chef course.\nThe staff here are friendly and caring, to the point where I feel like we are friends. Though some cases I saw a few people being reminded politely of their etiquette at the cafe area. Please be mindful of your surroundings and other guests 😊 since everyone wants to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere with their friends.\nThe restaurant team is also heeding to your comments and suggestions. I feel like the team here is very self driven to refine themselves to a better version everyday.\n\nThat’s all for my great experience at this hidden gem 😁",

The ingredients are very exquisite, including jellyfish, sand-worm, ant's egg.... but they are tasted so delicious and prepared in a way that is accessible to foreigners. For instance, the sand-worm was made into a mousse structure, somewhat like pate. My favorite is definitely the scallop and the grilled meat dipping in chicken and ants' egg. The tastes of these dishes are mindblowing :D\n\nBut what sets An's apart is not the food, but the atmosphere and the story-telling talent of the chef. I especially enjoy the story behind the dishes at An's, and how the Chef connects the meals together to create a coherent message.\nLooking at the ingredients, and how the chef created the food, I think he has deep gratitude and love for Vietnamese cuisines. He incorporated the specialities across Vietnam : Mountainous North, the Red River and Mekong Delta etc...\n\nThe Chef Table at An's is a very exclusive, but warm and welcoming experience. I enjoyed my time there so much. Thank you chef and the team at An's!\n\nP.s: I also looked at the menu alacarte, which serves guests dining outdoor/ on the patio. The price is very reasonable but of course doesn't include any of the dishes I ate that night. My friends had brunch there and said their Vietnamese-style traditional food were tasty. I think I will comeback oneday to try it out!",

                              "Found this hidden gem cafe/restaurant in Thao Dien during my trip visiting Ho Chi Minh City and was in love with the space, the atmosphere and the concept! Totally surprised how a beautiful place exists in the bustling city of Saigon. Staff was very professional and also accommodating.\n\nThier specialty coffee was a hit! My partner got a nice cold brew, I was served with the BEST ✨special edition✨ iced oat latte with salted cream & earl grey syrup.\n\nThen we discovered there was also a SPA on the second floor so we treated ourselves with one of the best relaxing massage we ever had in Saigon!\n\nSince I saw their “House rules” in the Drink Menu, I know (as a restaurant owner myself) it’s very hard to keep a place so well organised, calming and welcoming at the same time.\nThank you An’s for building and maintaining such a homey space! Kudos to your effort, please keep it going 🙌🏼",

                              "First I want to say that the recommandation of this restaurant is so well made. My friend find this place from the Korean search engine and me from the Michelin guide.\n\nWe had a la carte menu. Staff are so into details, very reliable, courteous and so attentive. They are everything you expected from a top quality staff. Clearly, how they twist the Vietnamese cuisine to bring the traditional Vietnamese cuisine to a modern interpretation is a blast!\n\nI have to give extra credit to the staff. To give context, I have Vietnamese roots and my friends are Korean and German. I have many allergies and one is vegan. Usually in specific place other it’s all in English or all Vietnamese explanation and I have to translate. I love how they let me speak in Vietnamese and give me explanation in Vietnamese and my friends in English. The level of attention is crazy. To the extend when we ask to have the bill split it was personalized. Experience wise. I love how they accommodate my friends and I.\n\nI am obviously not an expert and I don’t think I will have the correct vocabulary to describe the foods! I am so happy that I get to enjoy that food. The details the chef put into his creation is so precise. Everything we eat was without any doubt melting. I was so happy being there.\n\nI was so focused on foods that I forgot to take pictures. It’s how good it was!\nIncredible experience! This place is a must. Thank you guys!",

                              "I learned about An’s from recommendations of a few friends and I must say, they do live up to the expectation. We tried the A la carte menu and the specialty here is elevated Vietnamese cuisine with a creative twist. We were happy with everything we ordered but I would especially recommend to try banh goi, crab fried rice and the roasted duck. The total bill (after tax + service charge) was slightly more than VND1.5mil for 2, which we thought was very reasonable compared to other places in Thao Dien.\n\nThe whole experience was so pleasant, the waitresses were nice, polite and super attentive, they explained to me the ingredients of each dish carefully (as I am having some strict dietary requirements during my pregnancy). The space looks like more like a gallery than a restaurant, it’s giving old French villa vibe which I love. The only minus point was that there was limited parking space, so make sure you call to check beforehand.",

                              "Tucked away in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, An's Saigon offers an unforgettable dining experience that goes beyond just a meal. Here, I had the privilege of indulging in Chef Cuong Nguyen's \"Dong\" menu at his exclusive Chef's Table.\n\nThe Chef's Table is an intimate setting, perfect for a special occasion or a truly unique dining experience. Chef Cuong Nguyen himself acts as your host, guiding you through the intricate flavors and stories woven into each dish of the \"Dong\" menu. This specific menu, named after the Vietnamese word for \"land,\" focuses on showcasing the finest local ingredients and traditional cooking techniques.\n\nEach course was a revelation. Chef Cuong Nguyen passion for Vietnamese cuisine shone through in his masterful execution and innovative reinterpretations of classic dishes. The combination of textures and flavors was simply divine.\n\nBeyond the exceptional food, the true magic lies in the interaction with Chef Cuong Nguyen.  He shared personal anecdotes about the inspiration behind each dish, creating a truly immersive experience.  The conversation flowed effortlessly, making the evening feel more like a gathering with a dear friend than a visit to a restaurant.\n\nAn's Saigon Chef Table with Chef Cuong Nguyen is more than just a meal; it's a culinary journey that celebrates Vietnamese heritage and artistry. If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience in Ho Chi Minh City, I highly recommend booking a seat at this intimate table.\n\nAnd not forget to shout out to the FOH team, Chị My did a very well job to introduce and take care well of me.",

                              "Tucked in between shops in Thao Dien, “Okra Food Bar” is an hidden oasis of flavors; a delicate fusion of East and West.\n\nMy friends and I went here on Thursday night for a light dinner. The goal is to try as many variations of food as possible so we ordered a lot from their Starters option. “Okra” stayed true to the “food bar” concept by pairing up each food with drinks recommendations.\n\nAll of the creations we tasted were great and had exquisite presentation. I personally liked their:\n- Charred Okra\n- Grilled Broccolini\n- Halong Pacific Oysters\n- Sweet Potato Donut Holes\n- Sassy Peach mocktail\n\nAt first I was worried that the place will be a pretentious and overpriced establishment. Have to agree that the price is on the mid to high end. But the flavor profiles are unique and very well thought out. And there is a home-y quality to the food and overall vibe of the place. Which then leads me to my next point…\n\nThe hospitality and service was excellent. I was the first one to arrive but I didn’t feel awkward and alone since the staff chatted with me. Felt very welcome and they were very patient to explain each menu and provide their recommendations.\n\nDefinitely will come back. Next time around I will try their main dishes for sure!",

Every dish was well plated to give a fantastic dining experience.\n\nFavourites are: donut desserts, oysters, ‘not fries’, octopus and the seared grouper.

Loved that there was a DJ playing whilst we enjoyed dinner. Made the atmosphere very relaxed and cool. Would highly recommend and can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!

The all new, trendier Okra just opened a few hundred meters away from the original place with even more seating, a DJ and the same great food (and drinks).  We loved the new addition of Moroccan Scotch egg but the dish I come for every time is the NOT FRIES and didn’t disappoint. We ended on a high with the signature desert of sweet potato holes.  Great for a wind down after work or a weekend with friends/family. On second thoughts, you really don’t need need an excuse to visit Okra!",

The service was excellent and there is a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nWhen I mentioned that I have to eat gluten-free, they knew immediately and I was given clear statements about which dishes are gluten-free anyway, which could be adapted and how they would adapt them. I was able to take a quick look at the allergen list that the staff uses to double-check and saw that they differentiate between „gluten-free“ and \"safe for celiacs\" (based on this, I was advised against a gluten-free dish that is partly fried in the same oil as gluten-containing ingredients). Thanks to the team - the query couldn't have been handled better. Also worth mentioning that they made me very happy with their gluten free brownie dessert (dark chocolate, not so sweet and amazing texture).\n\nMy mocktail was very good and we would have liked to try cocktails as they sounded great, but unfortunately it wasn't the night for alcohol for us.",

Service was attentive but the food delivery took a long time. There were some hits and misses for us. First the hits. The gnocchi was delicious and the duck breast was well cooked. Now the misses. The grilled okra was under-seasoned, the sauce for the fish didn’t work for us as it reminded us of MacDonald’s curry sauce and my husband and I were not a fan of the sauce for the duck breast. Perhaps we had gone with too high expectations as several friends raved about this place. Mostly probably, we could have been unlucky and caught it on an off-day.",

I had the best steak ever here at cloud nine (you get a nice show as well and it gets cooked in front of you)!!! The atmosphere was romantic which was a bonus as we celebrated our anniversary here! Anh le was an incredible host and waiter all night. He was funny, polite and friendly! He asked if we would like any pepper and brought out a massive pepper grinder haha! To anyone who has him as a waiter is lucky! He made sure our anniversary was perfect and it was! The whole experience and food was a 10/10. My partner and I loved this place so much we will be back!!! Please come here for the amazing food, ambiance and staff. You won’t be disappointed! Also, they have good vegetarian options!",

The restaurant wasn't crowded, likely because we visited on a weekday. The ambiance is romantic and luxurious, making it an ideal spot for a couple's fine dining experience.\n\nMax Vu, the manager, was incredibly helpful. He received the flowers I had delivered earlier in the day and ensured everything went smoothly. He even texted me to ask for my girlfriend's name so they could prepare a personalized banner and put her name on the complimentary cake. He was friendly and provided excellent customer service.\n\nOur server, Ann Tran, was very polite and attentive. She made sure we enjoyed our meal and checked in on us regularly. Ann Tran and Max, along with the rest of the staff, surprised us with a birthday song, a banner, and a chocolate mousse cake, which we greatly appreciated.\n\nThis place is truly wonderful, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. If you are looking for great service, this is the place to go.",

Der Preis für die kleinen Portionen ist nicht wenig aber für europäische Verhältnisse absolut in Ordnung.\n\nDer Service ist wie im gesamten Hotel perfekt. Die Angestellten sind professionell, hilfsbereit und herzlich. Sie gehen auch auf individuelle Wünsche ein, selbst wenn es nicht auf der Karte steht.\n\nDas Ambiente ist top. Wunderschöner Ausblick auf den Pool und Hochhäuser. Die Einrichtung ist stilvoll. Wie überall in geschlossenen Räumen in Vietnam immer etwas zu kalt. In kurzen Sachen zu kommen kann ich daher nicht empfehlen.\n\nDennoch für 5/5 da es rund um ein super Aufenthalt ist.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nThe food is delicious (I recommended a small pinch more salt to the chefs as there are no salt shakers on the tables). The price for the small portions is not low but absolutely okay for European standards.\n\nAs in the entire hotel, the service is perfect. The staff are professional, helpful and warm. They also respond to individual requests, even if it's not on the menu.\n\nThe ambience is great. Beautiful view of the pool and high-rise buildings. The furnishings are stylish. Like everywhere else in closed rooms in Vietnam, it's always a little too cold. I can't recommend coming in short clothes.\n\nStill for 5/5 because it's a great stay.",

                              'We were expecting a lot from this restaurant, given the 5/5 rating on Google Maps, which we did not find warranted at all. There certainly were a few amusing "show" elements, with a blow torch here and dry ice there, but the substance--that is, the actual quality of the food and service expertise--was severely lacking. In my 5-course tasting menu, the appetizers were tiny, the salad thereafter ok but not splendid, and the main course average at best. The vegetarian main course was below par (a portion of dry rice, topped with cheese, with a tiny bit of veggies added), barely edible. The price was very high by Saigon standards, especially for what ended up on the plate. To top it all off, the restaurant did not accept USD (unlike pretty much anywhere else in the city), and an extra charge was added to pay by card. There is just no way this place deserves a score that high, and one can only wonder how this is possible.',

From the moment we walked in, the high-end atmosphere and soothing classical music set the perfect tone for the evening.\n\nWe started with the spring rolls, which were fresh and came with two delightful dipping sauces: fish sauce and peanut. For our main courses, we had the chicken roulade and pork short ribs, both of which were cooked to perfection and bursting with rich, savory flavors. The meal was perfectly capped off with the bombe Alaska, a dessert that was as beautiful as it was delicious.\n\nOur evening was made even more special by our server, Tran Pham, who was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout our meal. Her service was nothing short of exceptional, deserving a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nWhile you can expect to pay for the premium service and atmosphere, it is worth every penny. The food was divine, the service impeccable, and the overall experience was top-notch. We will definitely be coming back to Cloud Nine Restaurant.",
