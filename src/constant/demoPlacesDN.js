The Cham minority group were wiped out by Vietnamese after their leader was offered the hand of a princess, then using the pretext that she was not well treated, the Vietnamese invaded the Cham Kingdom, including destroying their residences and temples. Indeed a sad tale but one which is really common across many countries.\n\nThe museum is clean and quiet, the artefacts are not all whole, some are just feet, head without body, headless, etc. Fascinating that the Cham people worshipped Shiva the destroyer. His shrine is everywhere as well as Parvathy, his wife. The strong Indian influence is evident in the sculptures.\n\nThe museum is located directly across the tail of the dragon Bridge. Heaps of restaurants and cafes along the opposite street.",

The stark contrast to the Vietnamese culture is easily recognizable with many motives and deities from the Hindu influence. In summer time, the air inside is hot during the day , thus early morning or late afternoon will be a better visit time.\n\nThe museum can improve its exhibitions significantly by providing more interactive contents, for example VR or quizzes. I tried to use the automatic audio guide but failed due to a broken link. Connecting the exhibits points with the external sites and transportation services could be a good idea. An excursus about Vietnamese folklores and superstitions about the Champ culture could be also very interesting for the foreign visitors. The museum is concentrated on the sculptures and architecture in Champs culture alone, so many questions remain unanswered: how did the Champs offer their gods? How were their daily lives? How were there trading and relationships with one cultures?\n\nBecause this museum is the only museum about the Champs culture, I feel these aspects of the Champs culture are sadly neglected.\n\nAll in all, visiting the museum brought in me the reminiscent of long lost past and the melancholy of an once vibrant culture.",

These visual reminders were created as a way for practitioners to focus on the devoted path to honor nature and the eternal way of the truth and light.\n\nPlan to spend about a solid one hour to fully flow through the museum.

The site features multiple caves, elaborate temples, and scenic viewpoints. Visitors can explore the elevated walking paths or challenge themselves by climbing to the mountain tops. An elevator is available for those who prefer not to climb. At the base of the mountains, numerous shops offer marble souvenirs and statues.",

Make sure to give yourself 3-4 hours to have time to explore everything. Take the elevator UP, but take the stairs down. Conserve your energy for the plethora of hiking in the clouds",

The other 40k is some guide booklet with postcards, which you don't actually need since there are plenty of signs and maps boards once you get up. So unless you want the postcards, just ask for the lift ticket.\nThe temples and caves are nice and overall it's a nice hike.\n\nLook out for local stores who will offer to park your bike for 'free' in exchange for buying something small. Only that they don't have anything 'small' you'll be looking to spend from 150k and up. Thus you have 2 options: a) accept the parking and see it as a way to support the local economy which has been hardly hit during the pandemic, or b) keep driving until you reach the designated visitors parking.",

It‚Äôs been fun to return with friends and family who come visit us.\n\nA few tips to plan your visit. If you can go first thing in morning for less crowds but being there at 12 was super cool to see the light come into the large cave in the back of the complex.\n\nIt‚Äôs hot so bring hat and water but you will be able to buy drinks inside if you want. Would recommend good shoes (no flip flops) there are a lot of stairs and rocks to walk over and you don‚Äôt want to slip.\n\nYou can walk up and down mountain but I recommend the extra cost to take elevator especially going up. Walking down is not that bad if you want to safe some money.\n\nThis is good for all agree but could be hard for people with mobility issues.",

It was truly an amazing experience with breathtaking views of the city and definitely worth a visit.\n\nWhen planning your trip to Marble Mountain, it is advisable to come prepared with suitable footwear and dry wick clothing as the temperature can get quite hot. The tour itself takes approximately one hour, during which you will be treated to beautiful views from the top as well as inside the cave.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Marble Mountain if you ever find yourself in Vietnam. The panoramic views and unique cave formations make it an unforgettable experience.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I hope this information proves helpful in planning your future travels.",

We spent a few hours for the admission price of around 40000 dong, so around ¬£1.50.\nWe chose to climb the stairs and even though it was a warm and humid day, as well as busy, we‚Äôre glad we did.\nThe sculptures we saw looked fantastic, and lots of photogenic pagodas. Some looked a little worse for ware, but it added to the aesthetic of the place.\nWhen you get to a sign that talks about steep stairs, it actually means you‚Äôre going to climb through quite a tight cave! So only attempt if fit and able, and have good footwear as it‚Äôll be slippery.\nOne of the caves you walk down in to is a brilliant picture spot with a bright ray of light shining in to the temple cave.\nWould come back here again if we had the chance.",

We only had an hour and didn't write see everything, not knowing there were much more sites on the mountain other than a marble temple. There are things to climb and a shrine in a cave and a waterfall I think amongst other marble temples and ornaments. I recommend bringing solid shoes for a hike. Sneakers will also do. There are beautiful view points and nature to be enjoyed. If you're sort on time, take the lift.",

Caves go about Buddhist statues debating the virtues of right and wrong, tying them to potential forms of punishment.\n\nCertain viewpoints are stunning, marble caves can be one of a kind, and stairways are well set. A bit of stair climbing is to be expected, set up an hour or two for exploring and experience at your own pace. Be mindful, visiting hours are until 5, go close to these hours to catch some beautiful sunset views on top (December).\n\nThe other side has an elevator up to the top directly which needs extra charge. Tourists can also walk up the stairs from the other side by themselves. There are temple, tower and Buddhism statues that can be seen. Suggest to take the elevator up and walk down.",

Really nice little walk. Bear in mind you have to be slightly fit to do this as there‚Äôs a lot of steps and steep climbs. You need to pay 40k per person for the mountain. Then 20k for a separate cave down the bottom. The Heaven staircase climb up is easy but down you‚Äôll need to fit through some tight gaps. Also it is a marble mountain so it is a bit slippery",

The added value of having a knowledgeable tour guide cannot be overstated. They provided detailed insights into the history of why and how the mountain was built, as well as the types of stones used in its construction.\n\nOne fascinating aspect is the bullet holes in the stones of the walls, a stark reminder of the conflict between the Vietnamese people and the Americans, who were shooting at each other. Additionally, the holes in the cave at the top were created by bombs dropped by the Americans during the Vietnam War. This historical context added a deeper layer of appreciation for the site. Overall, Marble Mountain is a must-visit, combining natural beauty with a compelling historical narrative.",

Tickets for it all, including 1-way elevator ride will be 75k per person.\n\nIf you're looking to see it all, be ready for mild  exercise at least if you're not in great shape. You can see it all in about 1.5 hrs if you don't really stop for pictures, rest, or just to bask in the views. We spent about 2.5 hours and saw every bit of it at our own pace while taking photos everywhere.\n\nThe highest peak is tucked away behind the seating area near the restrooms, and walking up it is like going up a steep Stairmaster. I recommend it.\n\nBe sure to go into all the pathways for the main cavern at the base; it's a whole different vibe down there.",

Or just skip it and save money. As we went on a Saturday too much crowd and waiting period for the lift and to take pics also too much . Separate ticket to go up in the lift and separate ticket to come down. I have seen better places so its a waste of money and time.",

There are many sites worth visiting, so it's best to go either early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds and the heat. It takes about 2-3 hours to see everything. One thing to be cautious of is parking with the locals. They have stalls along the road and charge for motorcycle parking.",

There are several statues carved but this unique cave is so beautiful.\nMust visit place. You get to catch a small elevator upto 1/3rd of the mountain.  Rest you explore the place walking the steps.\n\nOnce you are done you climb down the mountain and end up to a place where there are lot of local vendors selling marble carved Buddhas and other sculptures. Suggestion is to buy little inside as the prices differ. We entered to one shop where she started off for a small statue for 1.2M dong. We were leaving the place and I could see one lady who was sitting next to the shop started following us every shops we went. Very spooky.\nShe manipulates the other vendors with her price. We left from there. Came the second day and got what I want. This time I wore a mask and played them. Got way cheap than they quoted initially.",

Mountains are high but not hard to climb. It‚Äôs more like elevated walking paths unless you want to climb to the top then it‚Äôs challenging. However, there‚Äôs an elevator for those who do not want to climb. Really recommend going there! We were there for three hours. Entrance price is 40,000 VND for adults only, children do not pay. If you want to take the elevator up, it's another 15,000 dong.\n\nThere are a lots of steps to traverse, so those who find stone steps challenging please take your time and enjoy the parts of the area which don't require too many steps. There is a lift which takes you from ground level to the main walking level above. That ticket price is slightly more than the ticket to walk up directly. Beautiful Scenery!\n\nOn the base of the mountains there are thousands of shops which sell stones, marble souvenirs or even large statues of almost everything you can think of.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth to visit!!!",

Please know this is a mountain. There are many, many steps & the terrain is uneven. The elevator (there is a small charge for the elevator in addition to the admission) only takes you part way up the hill to a small viewing area, there are A LOT of steps after that also. If you are heat sensitive, be cautious. Most areas are small with little air flow.  The mountains are truly spectacular. There are many paths & ‚Äònooks & cranny‚Äôs‚Äô to explore, however, know what you are embarking on before going. If you have the physical means to do this, I highly recommend!",

Plan to spend more time here, and the hawkers here are at another level, just forewarning you. Don't take the lift down, walk more to see. If you want more info use a local guide, I used Google after to find out what I was looking at.",

While the terrain can be a bit demanding with its ups and downs, the small shrines and temples nestled among the rocks and caves create a truly enchanting atmosphere that makes the effort worthwhile.\n\nThe entrance fees are quite reasonable and well worth the experience.\n\nYou should plan to spend around 2-3 hours to complete the entire circuit. The exact duration will depend on how much time you spend at each site and your overall fitness level. Whether you take your time to absorb the serene beauty or move at a quicker pace, this place offers a magical experience that shouldn't be rushed.",

However after going up the lift we soon can to realise it wasn‚Äôt. The steps can be very dangerous especially when it‚Äôs raining. Beware of the vendors at the bottom of the mountain, they will be waiting. One follow us for about 200 meters after we repeatedly told her we don‚Äôt have enough space. It is a nice place and I will recommend come here if you like the stair master. There are things to see if you do not like steps as well.",

The museum's illusionary paintings can only be fully appreciated through photos or videos, as they create a 3D effect that is not easily seen in person. The large open rooms are perfect for taking photos, but can also result in a lot of noise and echos, especially with children around.",

Still we managed to get nice clicks here while sweating a lot.\n\nOverall it was very good experience, less people were there so we got time to click at backgrounds..nice background 3d paintings. Some backgrounds were awesome and we got good clicks, some were not so good.\n\nIt was worth the ticket amount and spent 1-2 hours here.",

It is only through photos or videos that makes everything seem 3D. I thought it was very cool, they had various large open rooms. Although that also resulted in it being very loud because noise would echo in the room, especially if there are children around. I‚Äôve visited a place like this in Vancouver before that was half the size of this place and that was definitely not worth it. But this place is much better, definitely recommend for people that likes photos.",

If someone really wants to enjoy and click the photographs with these entire 3D paintings, it needs around 1.5 hour.

                                   "The museum is located in an industrial area-like a community. It was mostly empty even on weekends. It has two stories of 3D art with many sections and artifacts of every kind. Some artifacts are good and worth it. The place is well-maintained and clean. Staffs are good but the price ticket is a little high compared to the art. There is a parking space and a cafeteria too.\n\nIt time recommended but it is not connected to public transportation.",

                                   "We recently visited the 3D Museum in Danang and unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with my experience. While the concept of a 3D museum is intriguing, the execution fell short in several aspects.\n\nFirstly, the ticket prices were quite pricey at 200k Vietnamese dong. Considering the overall quality of the museum, it felt like an overpriced affair. Additionally, the maintenance of the museum was subpar. Many areas were poorly maintained, with signs of wear and tear, ceiling tiles coming off or missing, water leaks throughout the building. This lack of attention to detail detracted from the overall experience.\n\nThe idea behind the museum is commendable, and there were some nice paintings on display. However, not every artwork was suitable for 3D presentation. Some pieces felt forced into the 3D format, resulting in a less immersive experience. It would have been better if the selection of art had been more carefully curated.\n\nOne major inconvenience was the requirement of bringing your own camera to fully enjoy the museum. It would have been more convenient if the museum provided cameras (especially for groups or person with children)  or at least offered rentals. This additional cost and hassle could have been avoided with better planning on their part.\n\nLastly, the museum had a noticeable odor, which was quite off-putting. It would have been preferable if the management had taken steps to address this issue, as it affected the overall ambiance of the museum.\n\nIn conclusion, while the 3D Museum in Danang has a great concept and some nice paintings, the lack of execution, high ticket prices, poor maintenance, need for personal cameras, and unpleasant odor left much to be desired. I would recommend exploring other attractions in the area before considering a visit to this museum.",

                                   'An Incredible Buddhist Statue.\nThe White Statue of "Lady Buddha" is the tallest statue in Vietnam--- standing about 220 feet high! It is locate outside Da Nang, on a beach, in a Buddhist Temple complex. This "attraction" has been named, in 2018, TripAdvisor\'s "Travellers Choice" award. Its location, and artistry make it absolutely stunning! In the Morning, with its "coolness" and colours make it outstanding--- while at early evening, the "City lights" of Da Nang provide a remarkable back drop. The large and colourful Pagoda Gate is also a very impressive entrance. The park like setting is very large-- covering about 50 acres!\n\nI hope that this review has been helpful.',

It were raining most of the time, but I believe it added a new dimension to the beauty of the place.\nI was impressed of the many - maybe hundreds - of bonsai trees - Very beautiful - most of these vere fig trees, which normally grow 30 meters high.",

The wind was strong and waves treacherous so it's understandable.\nThere were no people and the area is full of unfinished hotels.\n\nThere was one lifeguard on duty but he was sleeping.\n\nMaybe in the future it's worth going here but for now, we wasted our time driving down there looking for a less busy beach.",

Despite its reputation, the beach seemed overrated and lacking the expected charm.\n\nThe atmosphere was oddly quiet, almost abandoned, and didn't offer the vibrant vibes we had anticipated. While it might be suitable for those seeking solitude, for others looking for a livelier beach experience, it fell short.\n\nAdding to the negative experience, we even came across a deceased snake, which raised concerns about the safety of the area.\n\nGiven the underwhelming experience and the concerning sighting, I would recommend considering other beaches in Da Nang and skipping Non Nuoc Beach altogether.",

The beach chairs were super worth it as they only cost 40k per person. The downside is only that you‚Äôre allowed to swim only in certain areas and not everywhere. A tip is also to come early in the day as all the locals come to the beach after 16:00, so it gets really busy then but before that the beach is empty.",

Usually, people start coming here from 3 pm onwards. Although there's no sunset here, many tourists come to swim, play, sunbathe, or try the restaurants along the beach. Even in the evening, the beach is still bustling with people.\n\nMy Khe Beach is renowned for its blue skies, fine white sand, gentle slope, clear and warm water all year round, and beautiful surroundings with coconut trees. Everything around this beach is peaceful, natural, and relaxed.\n\nMy Khe Beach is an ideal and safe place for adults and children to swim anytime throughout the year. It also offers stunning sunrise views, so try to stay close to the beach to enjoy the breathtaking scenery right from your room.\n\n#Mykhebeach #Vietnam #Danang #DanangVietnam #travel",

The rides are more fun and entertaining as well as scary sometimes.\nSpecially, the queen cobra roller-coaster ride was a breathtaking one, which everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime. Also, they have columbus ride, free fall, and other merry go round rides for children and elders.\nThe ferris wheel have a birdeye view of whole da nang, which is decorated with colorful ligts and beautiful bridges along the river. The dragon bridge is one of its type not found in any other place.\nThere is more of a sight seeing experience which is awesome with its colorful garden, and castles like buildings.\n\nWe are super excited on seeing the various architectual designs and castles and the colorful surroundings where everyone will feel stress free and relaxed just by visiting here.",

                                   "Great place for children (and big kids). The place is very good value, as not expensive to get a ticket - particularly via an app like Klook. When you arrive there's tons and tons of rides with limited queues so it's very easy to go in whatever you'd like, even multiple times (we did go on a Thursday evening in August). Recommend going late afternoon so you aren't in the baking sun, also to bring cash so that you can get refreshments like water around the park. Rides are good fun, particularly the Indian zone coaster and the Japan zone waltzer. Really enjoyed the theme park. The Ferris wheel is okay, best at night but not that great, though you get good views through only slightly mucky glass. Great day out!",

Also has an inside arcade game room and multiple electric child cars and food stands spread around. The main advantage of the park is that it is not too crowded, we almost didn't have to wait between the attractions and this didn't happen to me often.\n\nWe combined this with a morning visit to Marvel mountain (few hours) and lunch and shopping in a nearby mall.",

There is a large wheel in the park which is the major attraction of the park and it is one of the most recommended attractions. The wheel roller is big and can give a magnificent view of the city. It is safe and well-maintained by the staff. The top ticket price has unlimited rides off the wheel. Even on weekends, it was not so crowded and most of the sections of it were under maintenance or closed. You can spend approximately two to three hours enjoying some rides and viewing some decorations. There were few food stores and game shops but it is not included in high-priced tickets. There is a parking space near the entrance gate which cost 5k.",

The rides were great, lots were open and the Queen Cobra was one of the best coasters I've been on. There were rides for every age. We travel with 6 & 11 year old kids and there was lots to do for them. Rides were height based as you can see by the brochure. Coatsers, swings, bumper cars , swing boats...Many food stalls to choose from. The price was amazing, a family of 5 was 500,000 including the Sunwheel. We easily spend 5 hours and could have done more. Worth a visit for sure.",

Barely could see any crowd over the weekday and the amusement park was completely empty as well. Another highlight of the park is the roller coaster too which looks great on the video and pretty scary too. I wanted to fly my drone over the area but unfortunately it lies in the restricted zone which requires prior permission. To end it, the view from the top of the sun wheel looks absolutely magestic. A must try for everyone who visits Da Nang.\nJust a pointer for everyone, the Sun wheel only operates after 17:30 or so.. so i advise everyone to reach around that time only !\nCheers !!",

Parking is paid, but visitors have an option to park the vehicle for free at lotte mart nearby. There are some nice statues and backgrounds in the park for nice pictures. Entry is free if you just want to explore and take pictures. Individual tickets for rides and wheel can be purchased. If you have a late night flight,  it is a good option to kill some time",

It is nice to have the park to yourself but it also takes away a bit of fun. If you do not have much time, I would skip this and only go to Ba Na Hills which are far more better and bigger. Also a few rides where closed. If you plan to go do that in the evening when everything has more light and is more nice to see. A few hours should be more than enough to do everything at least a few times.",

Lower your expectations before coming as it is a very small park with a handful of things to do, but the rides they do have are awesome. The park was almost completely empty when we visited on a Friday. It was still really fun, with 3 of their 4 roller coasters open. I would recommend getting tickets to the haunted house as it‚Äôs a fun (however very cheaply made) walkthrough. This place is well worth the money, and we easily spent an entire day there. My main criticism would be a lack of food options within the park, almost the complete opposite of Ba Na Hills. Almost no vegetarian or vegan options, so maybe bring food with you. Make sure to visit this place if you are any sort of fan of theme parks, but just don‚Äôt expect too much and you‚Äôll be very happy with what you find there.",

But some rides were only open at certain times, and you had to pay extra for things like the haunted house or the Sun Wheel.\n\nOne cool thing about the park is that it's divided into different countries, each with its own decorations.

                                   "I almost missed this Pagoda while searching for it, and ended up walking right passed it a few times as I was expecting it to be visible from the street. As it turns out, it's tucked in behind a bunch of buildings, with a slightly obscure sign indicating it's presence from the street. It's also located in a pretty busy industrial part of Da Nang, which I also was not expecting.\n\nOnce you walk in to the main area however, it' actually surprisingly calm and serene. This is an active temple, and I wasn't sure if it was ok to walk around inside so I only took photos from the outside looking in. It did have some very beautiful architecture and carvings on it's two floors.\n\nThis is a very small site though, with mostly restaurants and industrial shops around the area and not much else. I believe walking distance-wise it was a good 45 minutes from the dragon bridge, so depending on your plans and time constraints in Da Nang, it may not be worth adding to your itinerary.",

The stall owner literally blended 3 avocados with a cup of water to get this super rich and thick consistency. 100% avocado goodness for sure!

Although in the peak hour this market is kind of crowed, but you will never forget the food here.\n\nI recommend you try the avocado ice cream, pho and hand-made pork spring roll here. This price is very cheap as this place is open for locals. When you finished meal, you can buy some bananas and feed monkey in monkey mountain.",

She gives an amazing massage and facial; her hands are strong enough to dig into your fascia and she uses the bamboo roller to release ALL of your lactic acid. I give 5 stars for the services, but only 3-4 stars for the reception staff as we had a very rude employee upon entering; she didn‚Äôt explain the treatments to us, and when she said that our treatments would end at 9:30 she said it was fine while passively aggressively reminding us that ‚Äúwe close at 9.‚Äù Four other customers ended their treatments at the same time as us but she clearly wanted us all to GTFO.

                                   "Fantastic experience. If you‚Äôre living in Da Nang or just visiting, here‚Äôs what you need to know about this Spa:\n\n- Really amazing service. Probably the best out of the 10+ spas my partner and I have tried in Da Nang/Hoi An\n- Pretty extensive menu with unique treatments that I really appreciate (especially the bamboo bar! Great for athletes, It‚Äôs like getting a roll out)\n- BEST ATMOSPHERE, it‚Äôs what brought us here and definitely a large reason for our return. The rooms are SICK, I‚Äôm a huge history buff so these artistic rooms inspired by ancient civil actions like Egypt is TOP CLASS\n- Really strong and skilled staff. I‚Äôll say, might not be the BEST all around massage I‚Äôve gotten but because there are plenty of other therapists here that, I‚Äôm sure after a few more visits, I could easily find my favorite therapist here making this my all around favorite spa in Vietnam.\n- VEGAN SNACKS! A major advantage this spa has over others is their offering of Tofu and coconut milk dessert after the massage, we‚Äôre both vegan and can usually never enjoy the after service care, but here we can! It really wraps the experience up very well.\n\nI‚Äôd highly recommend, definitely try a few therapists if you‚Äôre here for a while, otherwise, check the reviews for any names that pop up frequently, they are probably your best bet. Either way, you can‚Äôt go wrong here.\n\nSo is the high price worth it??\nABSOLUTELY. I‚Äôll be back soon :)",

To top it off, they also serve a special coconut tofu dessert after your treatment which many spa places doesn't do.

The staff was very professional and the masseuse was as skilled as the best massage therapists I see in Canada!! For a fraction of the cost, I might add. Before the start of the massage, I was presented with a diagram of the body where I could check areas I would like them to focus on, as well as areas I didn‚Äôt want them to massage. In writing, I had the opportunity to choose light, medium or strong pressure, plus I was informed how I could request more or less pressure, if I wished to do so during the massage. I was also shown the lotion and oil options, which I really appreciated, because I have some scent allergies. They clarified in advance that the therapist will wash her hands before a face massage, and details like that. The massage room was very clean and quiet, with soft music playing. The therapist worked on areas where my muscles were knotted and tight and after my 90-minute bamboo treatment, my shoulders and neck felt noticeably improved and relaxed. The therapist was knowledgeable about massaging effectively without inducing discomfort or pain. I was thrilled with the treatment! After it, I was served a hot tea and a refreshing fruit dessert, and given water to go. Even my husband was catered to and served while he waited for me. I highly recommend the bamboo massage at the Queen Spa.",
