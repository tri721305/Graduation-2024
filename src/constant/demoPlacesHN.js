Actually, nothing is too special about the lake. Just a Chinese temple in the middle of the lake. But, around the lake, there are numerous attractions from historical sites to hotels, food and beverages as well as shopping. As it is an iconic lake of Hanoi, tourists must visit here as the sign that you have been to Hanoi. At the lake side, you can sit and rest. Locals also organize gathering, picnic, event, etc. As it is within walking distance from Old Quarter, you may walk from your hotel at Old Quarter to this lake.",

Plenty of young locals taking pictures and more senior ones chillaxing and gambling.\n\nDefinitely not something to be missed as a tourist attraction as the lake (besides the West Lake) is a major thing of Hanoi. Recommended to come in the late evening or early morning as it's less hot and soak in the vibrancy of the place",

During my recent visit to Vietnam's capital city, I had the pleasure of exploring this enchanting landmark, and it left a lasting impression on me.\nSurrounded by lush greenery and shaded walkways, Hoan Kiem Lake offers a peaceful escape from the bustling streets of Hanoi. Whether you're taking a leisurely stroll along its shores or sitting on one of the benches to admire the view, the tranquil ambiance of the lake is truly rejuvenating.The centerpiece of the lake is the iconic Turtle Tower, standing majestically amidst the shimmering waters. Legend has it that the tower is home to a sacred turtle, adding to the mystique and allure of the area.One of the highlights of my visit was crossing the charming red bridge to reach Ngoc Son Temple, located on a small island in the lake.\n\nThe temple's intricate architecture and rich history provided insight into Vietnam's cultural heritage and spirituality.Hoan Kiem Lake also serves as a vibrant hub for locals and tourists alike, with activities such as tai chi sessions, street performances, and traditional water puppet shows adding to its allure.Whether you're seeking solace in nature, immersing yourself in Vietnamese culture, or simply enjoying a leisurely day out, Hoan Kiem Lake offers an unforgettable experience that will leave you enchanted and inspired.Overall, my time spent at Hoan Kiem Lake was a highlight of my trip to Hanoi, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city",

                         "Hoa Lo Prison Relic, also known as the Hanoi Hilton, is a museum that was originally built by the French colonial government in the late 19th century to detain Vietnamese revolutionaries and dissidents. Later, it housed American prisoners of war during the Vietnam War, including well-known figures like Senator John McCain. The museum showcases the history of war crimes and offers a glimpse into the harsh conditions endured by inmates.",

The atmosphere is both somber and reflective, giving visitors a chance to understand the struggles faced by those imprisoned there.\n\nThe ticket price is reasonable, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I recommend taking your time to read the displays and absorb the history. If you're in Hanoi, Hoa Lo Prison is definitely worth a visit!",

They show case the life of prisoners and what happened during the US invasion. They also sell milktea and snacks for a cheap price. worth visiting if you are into history",

                                   "This was a very cool and interesting museum. It’s built on the former site of the Hoa Lo Prison (Hilton - Hanoi) and has a lot of interesting photos and exhibits from the prison during its active years.\n\nThe staff are friendly and approachable. You can also expect entry to be ~30 baht per person. I would say that no more than 1-2 hours is needed as the museum only takes up a small portion of true former prison grounds.\n\nWith it centella located to the old quarter in Hanoi it’s easy to get here by walking or getting a taxi or grab!",

It takes around 30 min to 1 hour to visit all the cells and look at the exhibits of items used during those days. There are posters displayed regarding the wars.

Known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\" during the Vietnam War, this site is steeped in history and offers a sobering glimpse into the past.\n\nThe exhibits are meticulously curated, providing a comprehensive narrative of the prison's history from its construction by the French colonists to its use during the Vietnam War. Walking through the narrow corridors and dimly lit cells, I could almost feel the weight of the stories held within these walls. (Yes - get the audioguide...it is Sooo worth it)  The personal accounts, photographs, and artifacts brought the history to life in a way that was both educational and emotional.\n\nOne of the most poignant sections of the museum is dedicated to the American POWs who were held here. The exhibits do an excellent job of conveying the harsh realities they faced, as well as the resilience and camaraderie that helped them endure. It’s a stark reminder of the human spirit’s capacity to withstand even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nWhat struck me most was the contrast between the prison's grim past and the bustling, vibrant city that surrounds it today. It’s a powerful testament to the passage of time and the progress that has been made. This place is not just a museum; it’s a place of reflection and remembrance, offering valuable lessons about history, resilience, and the importance of peace.\n\nIf you’re in Hanoi, I highly recommend a visit. It’s a profound journey through history that will leave you with a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s past and a greater appreciation for the present.",

My favorite part was the story of their escape, but you better go visit so you can hear it for yourself. 😉\n\nNote: Lots of walking and some stairs, but there are many seats available where you can rest.

It was intended to hold Vietnamese prisoners, particularly political prisoners agitating for independence who were often subject to torture and execution. It gave me very great insights into the life of Vietnamese revolutionaries during the First Indochina War. I’ve learned the Hà Nội history  through this place and it gave me a very deep impression and valuable lesson.",

Inside the building, I was able to learn about Ho Chi Minh's unknown facts along with the sanctity of the place. When entering the mausoleum, I was required to check my physical condition and was warned to pray quietly. In the surrounding park, you can reflect on your experience at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum while taking a break. However, it can get very hot and crowded with tourists during summer, so I recommend visiting on weekdays in the late afternoon. To understand the history and culture of Vietnam, please be sure to visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.",

In addition to the Ho Chi Minh Memorial Hall, there are also the Ho Chi Minh Museum and the One Pillar Pagoda in the southwest that can be visited.\n\nOpposite the Ho Chi Minh Memorial is the National Assembly.

                                   "The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi, Vietnam, is one of the most significant historical and cultural landmarks in the country. It houses the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh, the revolutionary leader and former president who played a key role in Vietnam's fight for independence. The mausoleum is located in Ba Dinh Square, where Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence in 1945.\n\nArchitecturally, the mausoleum is an imposing granite structure, influenced by Lenin’s Mausoleum in Moscow, yet it incorporates distinct Vietnamese touches. The solemn atmosphere reflects the reverence the Vietnamese people hold for their national hero.\n\nVisitors, including foreigners, can enter the mausoleum and pay their respects. The experience is orderly and respectful, with a strict dress code and rules prohibiting photography inside. The line to enter is usually long, but it moves efficiently thanks to the disciplined guards.\n\nIf you get the chance to visit, entering the mausoleum is a profound experience, offering insight into Vietnam’s deep respect for Ho Chi Minh and its history. Keep in mind that the mausoleum is typically closed for maintenance for a few months each year (usually from September to November), so it's good to check ahead of time if you plan to go.",

I went with a small group of fellow tourists and I think I was literally the last person they let in before they closed it.  It is very similar to Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow (gee, I wonder why?) in that once you enter there are guards everywhere and you better not stop walking, even as you pass the wax-looking figure in a glass case.  Once you are through the mausoleum you can slow down and enjoy some of the other nearby sites like the single-pillar pagoda or Ho Chi Minh's stilt house.",

                                   "The Temple of Literature (Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám) in Hanoi is a remarkable historical and cultural site, dedicated to Confucius and serving as Vietnam's first national university. Built in 1070, the temple showcases ancient Vietnamese architecture with five courtyards, tranquil gardens, and a series of pavilions and altars. The Stelae of Doctors, inscribed with the names of successful students from past imperial examinations, is particularly significant, reflecting Vietnam's long tradition of scholarly excellence. Visitors are often struck by the peaceful atmosphere amidst the bustling city, making it a perfect spot to appreciate Vietnamese heritage and take a break from the urban pace.\n\nTo make the most of your visit, try to go early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid crowds and the midday heat. Hiring a guide or using an audio guide is highly recommended to fully appreciate the site's rich history and symbolism. Be respectful of the temple's religious significance, dress modestly, and be mindful of photography restrictions, especially around altars. The souvenir shops nearby sell traditional Vietnamese items, including calligraphy, which make unique keepsakes. Finally, set aside at least an hour to explore the entire site and take in the details.",

                                   "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nVisiting the Temple of Literature in Hanoi was an incredible experience! This historic site, dedicated to Confucius and Vietnam's scholars, offers a serene escape from the city's busy daily lifestyle.\n\nThe architecture is stunning, with beautifully preserved pavilions, courtyards, and gardens. Each section tells a story of Vietnam's rich academic heritage.\n\nWalking through the lush gardens and lotus ponds was calming and picturesque 🌿. The intricate details in the carvings and the tranquil atmosphere made it feel like stepping back in time.\n\nMight I suggest taking pictures from different standing points. Everyone walks the same path and often blocks your chances to take clear pictures. Walk some of the other paths and enjoy pictures with no people blockers 📸.\n\nAnd last but not least, purchase the audio guide. This was not offered to me, and I did not do my research, so I did not know this was an option until I was midway through my tour and at that point did not want to walk back.\n\nOverall, the Temple of Literature is a must-visit for anyone in Hanoi, blending history, culture, and beauty seamlessly.",

                                   "Ah, the buildings and gardens of this place, they are like whispers from the past, gently urging us to pause and reflect upon the journey of life. As I gaze upon these structures, I am reminded of the harmony that exists between the world of man and the world of nature. The architecture stands as a testament to the artistry of the human spirit, while the gardens, with their intricate design, beckon us to meditate upon the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nIn the midst of our bustling lives, it is easy to forget the significance of stillness. These surroundings, with their tranquil aura, serve as a reminder to cease the relentless march of time, if only for a moment. Here, the wind rustling through the leaves and the gentle babbling of water seem to whisper secrets of the universe, encouraging us to contemplate the true purpose of existence.\n\nMeditation becomes effortless amidst these surroundings, for the very essence of this place seems to invite introspection and contemplation. The gardens, meticulously nurtured, mirror the stages of life itself—birth, growth, decay, and renewal. As we wander through these sacred spaces, we are reminded of the impermanence of all things and the eternal cycle of change.\n\nThus, in this haven of tranquility, I find solace in the art of stillness and reflection. It is a sanctuary where one can stop time and ponder the profound questions that shape our existence. Let us heed the call of this place, for it whispers to us the wisdom of ages past, reminding us of the timeless pursuit of understanding the meaning of life.",

Compared to the one in Paris, it’s much smaller, less golden less velvet red, more white and sky blue, feeling less luxurious overall. The one problem we’ve had is the narrow seats. We’ve bought the cheapest range mainly to see the inside of the house. The seats in this range obviously don’t fit anyone of 1.8 m or XXL Vietnamese size. Only the two seats on the highest row shown in my photo have more room as they are next to a pillar.",

I never want to see another tree or plant in my life!)\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe Trấn Quốc Pagoda was constructed in the 6th century, making it almost 1,500 years old. It is the oldest Buddhist temple in the city, with several lotuses carved into the stone walls. Lotuses symbolize several things: the beauty of nature in Vietnam, the purity of the mind/body/speech, the achievement of enlightenment.\n\nThe most interesting part about this place is it’s Bodhi Tree, Which was originally a cutting taken from the tree in India where the Buddha sat and taught. They also worship mothers here, which for them is a term for “female Buddhas”, or female gods.\n\nI went here last year, and although it was closed at the time of my visit, the clear reflection in the water is what makes it stand out. Definitely visit it at sunset for a magical experience :).\n.\n.\n.Sanat , heykel , müze , park , orman , arkeoloji , kitap,  resim,  kafe , çay",

Reading them gives an idea of how world and kingdom evolve and how this temple is related to the kingdoms, You can Buy some souvenir sold in front of the temple , but they will be priced high ,need to bargain at 1/4 of price to buy at right price, if you plan to go to night market then you can prefer to buy there instead of buying here.",

No entry fee here.\nTran Quoc Pagoda is a serene and culturally rich destination nestled on the shores of West Lake in Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nAs the oldest Buddhist temple in the city, it exudes a sense of history and spirituality. The pagoda's picturesque setting offers visitors a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life.",

During the war in 1954, the One Pillar Pagoda was demolished by invaders’ bombs. After that, the government made major restorations to preserve the same.",

At the base, there are a plethora of wares. When I went here, there was an exhibition going on the second floor which was conducted in collaboration with another country's relevant authorities. About 2/5th of the boards ( on this floor ) were only in the local language. It was knowledgeable to know about the struggle, freedom movement, and action plans of the leaders back then i.a., and there is information available about plans, their implementation and after-effects during the early and mid-70s. There are also various quotes shown with the names of the leaders ( incl. photos in some cases ), and information about conferences, key strategic decisions and landmark movements/achievements i.a. There is also a succulent mention of the present global relations of the country.\n\nThe second and largest floor of the museum has a lot. Due to the time constraint courtesy to their lunch break time, I couldn't get to see even half the museum properly, but based on what I saw, it was again very interesting. There is a collection of objects used during the War times ( like various types of arrows, and prisoner uniforms ), personal items used by popular personalities, some historical paintings, stuff about the life of the founder ( incl a statue ), i.a.\n\nAnd now the superfluous elements.  The most surprising thing was the presence of some totally unconnected/unrelated items like fake fruits, metal flowers and leaves, and fake masks, i.a. Surely they look more better when they are seen in other shops, but definitely not inside the historical sites like a museum. I am not sure why the organisers saw it worthwhile to have them here, and the same space would have been used for other apposite boards/articles.\n\nThe entry ticket is VND 40,000, and like its counterparts, this museum too is closed for the lunch break and on Mon and Fri. There is also a cafeteria on the premises at the base near the exit. As for other museums in Hanoi, it would be in the good interest of the visitors if this lunch closing time is done away with. Surely, staff can go for lunch, but visitors should be allowed to continue to explore the museum. In the absence of the same, it becomes difficult for people who love history and museums to see the whole site in one visit given the timings.",

After he passed away on September 2nd 1969, in compliance with the Vietnamese people’s aspiration, the Communist Party of Vietnam’s Politburo decided to build the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and the Ho Chi Minh Museum. After 20 years of preparing and building, the Ho Chi Minh Museum was inaugurated on September 2nd 1990, on the occasion of the 100th birthday of the President. Ho Chi Minh Museum has more than 170,000 decuments, objects and films about President Ho Chi Minh’s life and revolutionary work. They are invaluable assets of the Vietnamese people in educating patriotism, studying and following Ho Chi Minh’s thought and moral quallties; and encouraging the Vietnamese generations to succeed failthfully and excellently his great revolutionary work.

The exhibitions showcased his interactions with world leaders, contributions from individuals across the globe, and his relentless efforts in securing Vietnam's independence.\n\nWhile the museum undoubtedly provides a patriotic experience, I couldn't help but notice a certain bias in its presentation.

The exhibits are rich with history, offering deep insights into the life and legacy of Ho Chi Minh and the broader context of Vietnam's struggle for independence. As you walk through the museum, you can truly feel the pride and resilience of the Vietnamese people. It’s a powerful place that not only educates but also inspires. A must-visit for anyone wanting to understand the heart and soul of Vietnam.",

They also don't take student discounts, this was the only museum out of the many I went to in Hanoi that didn't.\n\nThe building is incredible, and the displays look cool, but the information isn't well organized or clear. There are so many fascinating items, but it is so hard to go through the exhibit and get a clear picture.\n\nI know very little about this history and came hoping to learn more, but I didn't. The National Museum was better for learning but very stale compared to the aesthetic quality of this museum.",

They didn't allow me to take my camera inside (but after I went in all the others were taking their cameras inside). I have submitted my camera at the baggage collection counter. After I came back to the counter it was closed and they asked me to go to the other end of the premise to collect it. I went all over the premise asking for my camera . But they made me roam here and there. I walked for above 3 km searching for my cameras. At last I came back to the entrance and requested the officers to get my camera back. One Lady officer came with us and asked the security officer to bring it to us. (Don't remember her name, but I thank her for helping me) Then the security officer went to the other end and took my camera and other belongings to me. I was really worried because I have to leave soon and catch my flight.  That was a really bad experience. They should have kept the belongings where it was collected. Otherwise the tourists will be confused.",

The design is both grand and intimate, making it a perfect place for quiet reflection or to simply admire the craftsmanship that has stood the test of time.\n\nThe cathedral is not just a historical site but also a living place of worship. Attending a mass here, particularly on a Sunday, offers a unique cultural experience, blending the spiritual with the historical. The local community's devotion adds a layer of warmth and authenticity to your visit.\n\nThe surrounding area is equally charming, with quaint cafes and bustling streets that give you a taste of Hanoi’s vibrant culture. The cathedral's location makes it an ideal starting point for exploring the rest of the Old Quarter.\n\nIn summary, Saint Joseph’s Cathedral is more than just a beautiful building; it’s a symbol of Hanoi’s enduring spirit and cultural diversity. Whether you're a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or simply looking for a serene spot in the city, this cathedral should be high on your list.",

Visitor are welcome to enter inside but to be advised to keep a low voice especially during mass. The interior inside are beautiful with art influence of renaissance era, it's worthy to give it a visit.",

                                   "Standing in front of the awe-inspiring St. Joseph Cathedral in Hanoi, I was captivated by its Gothic-style architecture and imposing presence. Though I didn't enter the cathedral, I was still mesmerized by its exterior beauty.\n\nAs I gazed up at the intricate details of the twin spires reaching towards the sky, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and reverence. The soft light filtering through the stained glass windows cast colorful reflections on the cathedral's facade, adding to its ethereal charm.\n\nSurrounded by the bustling streets of Hanoi's Old Quarter, the cathedral stood as a beacon of serenity and grace amidst the chaos of the city. I took a moment to soak in the atmosphere, appreciating the peaceful ambiance and the sense of history that permeated the air.\n\nThough I didn't step inside, the experience of standing before St. Joseph Cathedral left a lasting impression on me. It was a reminder of the power of architecture to inspire awe and reverence, even from afar.",

It is easy  to miss the second building and it was pretty empty, so make sure to check it out.\nThe building next door has items from other Asian cultures. It's a newer building.\nThere is also a restaurant and a souvenir shop.\nOverall this is a good and very instructive place to find out different cultures of Vietnam..",

The best thing was I could see and learn more about sapa people which I visited few days ago. The building itself was modern architecture. Also, they displayed kind of traditional buildings of Vietnamese people outside the museum. They are open to visitors and could directly feel their culture which was very good experience. The only drawback was that food here was so expensive and mostly not related to Vietnam stuff like pizza.\nI was fortunate to see water puppet here. I don’t know even a word of Vietnamese but it was just funny and interesting to see it.",

                                   "This is a fascinating visit. A large and well designed museum that exhibits information about the different cultural groups of Vietnam. You can see artefacts, videos, images and read about so many different traditions, beliefs, customs and history. Available in 3 languages (Vietnamese, French and English) throughout. It also includes a wide variety of full sized homes that you can walk through and learn about, to find out how people live in different cultural groups. I loved it!",

                                   "Main destination in Hanoi!\n\nInteresting museum, especially garment history and architecture in mind. I loved being able to go into old stilt houses and studying the construction techniques.\n\nFew words of criticism:\n\nSignage is not very clear. I could not find a toilet in the new building and there was no one at the information desk. Had to use the restaurant toilet. WC signs are the most crucial part of a public building.\n\nLighting is poorly designed. The pieces could benefit from darker rooms with spots inside the cases. Often the TV monitors and lights are reflected in the glass and it's hard to see the objects.\n\nDo not miss the museum grounds! There are many wonderful old buildings there. Also note that the grounds have two museums. I thought there was just the old one and nearly missed the modern one entirely.\n\nGift shop:\nIt breaks my heart that they dismantle old museum quality native garments to make souvenirs like plush toys. Someone spent months lovingly hand embroidering and batique dying a piece of cloth that is now treated like rubbish. Sad fate to valuable old pieces of history.",

                                   "This museum is fantastic. A great way to learn about Vietnam, but also really the whole world! There are two very well air-conditioned  buildings. One building is for South East Asia more broadly, some works from all over the world, and a rotating exhibit (currently about everyday life in Korea). The second building is just about the different people of Vietnam.\n\nI learned so much through the signs in the South East Asia building about the pieces and how they relate to the culture.\n\nThe Vietnamese building was also interesting with some videos to watch - and it looked like you might be able to get an audio tour but I couldn’t see any signs to buy one.\n\nThe outdoor area was my favourite - but very hot as we went in summer. You can go into all the houses, and the signs explain what part of Vietnam the houses are from. There are also tombs and boats to look at, and lots of shade from all the trees.\n\nNote: To enter the homes, you must take your shoes off. Wear some easy to take on and off shoes! ☺️\n\nThere are 2 cafes, toilets and 2 souvenir shops too. For 40k ticket entrance, this is a must see. We really enjoyed our time and spent maybe 3 hours here, and got a hibiscus iced tea at the cafe after.\n\nOnly thing is getting a taxi when you leave is not super easy. We walked down the road a bit until we found one driving by.",

One can enjoy coffee, drinks , shopping and live music all around the streets. One can walk\ndown to Beer Street, Night Market and enjoy food at various cafés around. The place if full of Hotels, Spa Centres and Excursion booking shops. I recommend to book any hotel around so that  the walking down to street is easy. In days it’s too hot and you will not found much hustle around and as the sun goes down the city gets a new colour and Old Quarter actually start looking the new vibe of the city.",

It’s crowded like crazy and especially over the weekend it’s difficult to be able to sit but there are 100s of outlets so no sweat. Very vibrant though. The whole street has beer bars and you sit outside on small stools and chairs and grab beers and snacks. Lot of noise. Beers of different brands are available and flavours. We tried the Hanoi premier brand and it was light and good. Got one bottle for 35000 vnd. It’s buzzing and lively. Had cheese sticks.  they give minimum 4 cheese sticks and one is for 10000 vnd but real good and fresh with loads of cheese pull. You get a beer for even 10000 vnd. Tried fried corns too. These were good. Everyone will try to pull you to their outlet. No force though. You can sit and enjoy wherever you like. They also give you boiled peanuts. We thought these were complimentary but they charged us 20000 vnd later in the bill.\nIt’s damn crowded so be careful with yourself and your belongings",

It was a bit of a cultural shock at first but we quickly got used to it. The streets are packed with tourists and locals, all enjoying street food and beer (which is pretty cheap). We chose a place, were sat down and enjoyed the beer in the hectic enviroment, which was quite fun.\nThen the rain came. In about 5min it went from a few drops of rain to a full on shower, but the street vendors were prepared and set up umbrellas and immediately started giving out or selling rain coats. We were partially wet.. but who cares? Just enjoy the moment and have fun.. (doesn't hurt to be prepared with an umbrella or raincoat).",

Recommend starting with a drink at one of the tiny plastic tables + chairs outside and just watching the madness on the street for a bit. Around midnight, the action moves indoors (and if you’re seated outside drinking, you might be asked to quickly move inside for a moment if a police car passes by). At that point, you can easily start bar-hopping and checking out multiple different places to find one with a good vibe.",

Loads of soveniers, restaurants, coffee shops, paintings, lighting features, luggage bags, plenty of beautiful tree lined streets a highly recommended location to have a decent browse",

You can walk around and be lost in the alleys for hours; looking at ques in front of the local pho shops, sitting next to the busy streets having egg coffee or stopping a vendor to taste the rice donuts (don't as yet know what are they called). The transformation from the afternoon to the evening is simply dazzling. The brilliant architecture of few buildings comes to life with lights. The lakeside transforms itself from a hazy, humid, hot afternoon to a cool place just to sit around (must try the ice-cream here).",

There are plenty of restaurants where you can eat and drink but the rates are on the very higher side than the ordinary.\nFor me, it was not the place as I’m not a beer person and secondly, I avoid overcrowded and loud places.\nI went here just to experience the vibe which was high everywhere.\nDefinitely, the best place who want to explore the nightlife in Hanoi.",

It’s a bustling, chaotic, and electrifying experience that you won’t want to miss if you’re in the city. Picture this: narrow streets packed with tiny plastic stools, locals and tourists mingling, and an infectious energy that fills the air.\n\nWhether you’re enjoying a cold beer at one of the street-side tables, watching the world go by, or hopping from bar to bar, this street offers an experience like no other. Live music often breaks out spontaneously, and the vibrant atmosphere draws you in, making you feel like part of the community, even if just for a night.\n\nAs the night progresses, you might have to move inside if the police drive by, but that’s just part of the quirky charm. The street is packed with bars and food vendors offering everything from grilled skewers to steaming bowls of pho. It can be a bit overwhelming with so many options, but that’s part of the adventure. If you’re unsure, just go with the flow and pick the place that calls to you.\n\nAlthough it’s a bit tourist-heavy, Ta Hien Beer Street is a magical place where cultures collide, and every visit promises unforgettable memories. Grab a Bia Hoi, sit back, and let the night unfold in this vibrant corner of Hanoi.",

It’s just not something for me but it’s strictly my opinion. I’m sure many will find this place interesting. For someone who’s not into drinking and loud music, this may not be the place for you.

Now, if you haven’t heard of it, think of it as the Cheers bar of Hanoi – where everybody knows your name, or at least they will after a few beers.\n\nSo I turn the corner, and BAM! The place is alive! Tiny plastic stools everywhere, filled with people from all walks of life, all united by the universal language of cheap, cold beer. The vibe is electric – it’s like Oktoberfest decided to take a vacation in Vietnam and never left.\n\nI manage to squeeze onto a stool at a communal table, rubbing elbows with some locals and tourists who look like they’ve been here since last Tuesday. We start chatting – well, more like shouting over the symphony of clinking glasses, laughter, and sizzling street food. And let me tell you, the street vendors are like ninjas with snacks, slipping through the crowd with skewers of grilled meat and baskets of spring rolls. I sample a bit of everything, and it’s all phenomenal.\n\nSuddenly, a local guy with a guitar starts strumming some tunes. He’s like the Vietnamese John Mayer, minus the heartbreak. The whole street joins in, turning into this impromptu concert under the stars. I’m singing along with people I met five minutes ago, and it feels like we’ve known each other forever.\n\nAs the night goes on, I realize Ta Hien Beer Street isn’t just a place to drink. It’s this magical, chaotic, beautiful mess where cultures collide, friendships are forged, and every sip of Bia Hoi comes with a side of unforgettable memories. It’s where the spirit of Hanoi really shines – vibrant, welcoming, and absolutely unforgettable.\n\nSo, next time you’re in Hanoi’s Old Quarter, do yourself a favor. Head to Ta Hien Beer Street, grab a stool, order a Bia Hoi, and just let the night take you wherever it wants. Trust me, you’re in for one heck of an adventure.",

There are areas where there is no shade and it will get hot. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here. Don't forget to check out the underground bomb shelter and the museums inside the buildings, they're easy to miss. Great place to take kids. Some drinks and snacks are available to purchase inside.",

But we walked further in and found many little buildings which contain artifacts excavated from before. The doors to these displays were opaque and it was not obvious that there're things to see inside.\nI'm glad we spent more time to discover these. Perhaps better signage should be put up to direct visitors.",

The Imperial Citadel of Thang Long functioned as a royal court during 1800s and became a complex of imperial palaces. It became a prison chamber of French soldiers during World War 2 and was severely impacted by war. Today, it's listed as one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. At the entrance of the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, there's a mini-exhibit showcasing the history, culture, and traditions of Vietnam and its citizen. You can also visit other attractions such as Hanoi Flagtower and Vietnam Military History Museum to know more about the Vietnamese history and war vehicles used during the world war.",

You can see the whole thing in about 15-20 minutes, and it’s honestly not super interesting or beautiful. Worth a quick stop especially if you’re seeing the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum / museum nearby, but don’t expect to be blown away.\n\nEDIT: After reading other reviews I realize we missed virtually all the actual exhibitions here and just saw the main palace building. TBH I don’t blame us, the road to the other exhibitions seemed to be under construction and there wasn’t any map or signage indicating that there was anything at all to see that way.",

However, much work should have been done to maintain the vast gardens, which have been strewn with weeds. Having said that, the citadel vast compound provides you with the space to take a walk and enjoy the tranquility; much scope for provocative thinking when it comes to the history of Vietnam. It also offers many corners for you to take a photo or two. You cannot say you have been to Hue without visiting the citadel.",

We paid a total of 90k vnd (30k for people 15 and over) for admission. The ticket office is at the south gate side, not north like it shows on Google maps. Our three youngest children got in free. We were not expecting to enjoy our time as much as we did. Like other reviewers mention, there are many exhibits. It's important to note that not all the exhibits have a/c. We were glistening by the end of our visit, for sure. But it didn't take away from our experience. You can make your trip as fast or as long as you want. We spent a total of two hours at the main site (Southgate, exhibits, military bunker, military headquarter, and princess pagoda). When you exit, you can cross the street to see exhibit 18, or the archeological site, where you will need to show your ticket again to enter. It's an interesting walk through the excavated areas. We spent an additional 20 minutes or so at this site.",

Which meant one needs to find their own way back to the entrance and parking area along a busy street with terrible footpaths. If you aren't familiar with the area this would be quite disconcerting.\nFrankly, if one is set on visiting here, do it in the daytime and not with a tour.\nThe grounds are pleasant and the citadel is moderately interesting. But be clear, it's not particularly significant historically; the highlights appeared to be ground water wells that were a few hundred years old. Angkor Wat, it's not.",

                                   "it really is n't that impressive outside of the main entrance and the wall attached to it. Most of the old Vietnamese citadel is long gone replaced in places by 19th century French buildings, which are average looking at best and some 20th century Vietnamese additions that house exhibits and coffee shops. Nice enough grounds, but really, not a whole lot to see. If you're in Hanoi for just a day, or even two, I'd skip it.",

An interesting place but you'll get much more from the information panels as much of the tour was not in English, despite booking for it. This would allow you to go at your own pace, focus on what interests you and not miss things/spend too long on the parts that are of less interest.",

The theatre was almost full even in the time of restricted travel but they are taking care of safe distance. The host of this show were very nice",

The show is in Vietnamese but you will understand everything they are showing via puppets. You can also buy additional audio language packs if you like.

In all honesty, we both did not enjoy it. We both felt confused and didn’t really understand the hype surrounding the show. There were elements that were nice including the music and the puppets themselves but I felt like there was no true storyline so it was hard to get into it. I think if you want to experience it, try it but if your looking for something amazing you’re going to be very disappointed.",

Locals used to go to this show to just relax with family and have a good laugh after a long day of work. Approach this show with that mindset, and you will enjoy it even if you don't understand the words. I didn't bother with audio guide definitely not needed. You can use common sense to understand the stories. They are about life of locals in rural area and legends. We go the backrow seats (100k dong). The entire theater is not even that big so front or last row doesn't make that much difference.  We were on the last row and had perfect visibility to the puppets and performers on side stages.\nWe arrived a few minutes after the show start time and they still allowed us entry. I recommend to squeeze this into your day. :)",

My youngest son and I moved seats to the back when someone tall sat in front of him.\n\nWe hired 2 of the audio description headsets for 50k each.

It is unique by its nature and hard to perform as the success of a group performance always depends on the synchronisation of the group members. And, they have mastered it well. One bad / inaccurate move of a single person, can ruin the show. But, they practiced it so much, that you will see a flawless entertainment before your eyes.\nThe theatre hall, itself is placed in the prime location of Old quarter of Vietnam and is also considered as a landmark to reach the local shopping place.\nOverall a very nice and satisfying experience.",

The musicians are a gem crew themselves, with wonderful local music instruments. The show is comprised of everyday local life scenes that change one another, from planting rice to the Emperor visit. The legend of the Returned Sword on the lake opposite the theater is also played here. All the scenes prove the circle of Life is most important in Orient life. Another point is that this ancient art is carried through centuries and they keep it alive every day till today 365 days a year.",

It was so cute. It was so adorable. I would highly recommend this show for anyone.\n\nThe puppets and the way they make the movement I mean it’s funny. Yes, it’s sung sort of in Vietnamese language it was but I think if you can look at the motion of the puppets, you can kind of figure out what they’re doing.\n\nDefinitely go see this this is something you’ll never see anywhere in the world 🌎 unless",

The puppets are all just above the water and the music is all traditional. The dialogue is also in Vietnamese but the context can be ascertained from the actions of the puppets.\n\nThere is ample seating inside the theatre with the seats towards the front coating a little more, however this is not important as the seating is staggered so that the view is reasonably unimpeded regardless of where you decide to sit. The seating is also all allocated according to your ticket so there is no rush to get to your seats. The restrooms aren't especially clean but are good enough.",

In 45/60 min they perform life music in front of you and tell you stories about Vietnamese history, culture and traditions. Animation of puppets and music are so good that you no need translation, anyway there's no so many words and whole show. You just need to relax and enjoy.

We did not realize that one could also get translation in different languages. So we did not follow the narration or songs (they are in Vietnamese) but could only follow what was being shown. To cut waiting times, it is best to book tickets when you visit the sword lake temple and then go to the theatre 15 minutes before show time. You can also but some puppets after the show. Don't miss the souvenir shops around the theatre. All in all, this was the high point of our stay in Hanoi.",

                                   "The water puppet show in Hanoi, Vietnam, is a mesmerizing cultural experience that brings to life a traditional art form dating back to the 11th century. Held at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, this unique performance features intricately crafted wooden puppets that dance on water, skillfully manipulated by hidden puppeteers. The show is accompanied by live traditional Vietnamese music, including the use of bamboo flutes, drums, and cymbals, which adds to the vibrant and enchanting atmosphere.\n\nThe storytelling is both humorous and poignant, depicting rural Vietnamese life, historical legends, and folklore. Even without understanding the Vietnamese language, the visual spectacle and the expressive movements of the puppets make the narratives engaging and easy to follow.\n\nOne of the highlights is the play of light and water, which creates a magical ambiance, making the puppets appear to glide and float effortlessly. The coordination and skill of the puppeteers are truly impressive, showcasing a deep mastery of this age-old tradition.\n\nThe theatre offers different seating prices: 100,000 Vietnamese dong for the last row, 150,000 Vietnamese dong for the middle row, and 200,000 Vietnamese dong for the front row. Despite the tiered pricing, you can sit just about anywhere and get a good view, so there's no need to worry too much about your seating choice. Additionally, you can pay 50,000 Vietnamese dong for an audio guide, which is highly recommended. While you can still enjoy the music, visuals, and live performance without it, the audio guide provides valuable context, explaining what each story is about. Though it doesn't translate verbatim what the puppets are saying, it offers a quick narrative either before, during, or after each performance, significantly enhancing your understanding.\n\nOverall, the water puppet show in Hanoi is a delightful and culturally rich experience, offering a glimpse into Vietnam's heritage and artistry. It is a must-see for anyone visiting the city, providing entertainment and insight into the country's rich cultural tapestry.\n\n- loved when the puppet performers came out at the end of the show.",

Entry is 40k, audio guide is 50k although I didn’t go for it.\n\nThere’s a lot to see so I’d recommend carving out a good hour or two to get through it all. Even if you breeze through a few rooms, the museum’s layout is rather confusing and it’s easy to miss something incredible hidden away. My advice is to work floor by floor and be careful not to miss the rooms hidden at the  far ends of every corridor.\n\nSignage could do with some work.",

This is by far the most up-to-date and worthwhile one. The rest you can skip.\n\nIF you are into ancient and contemporary art mixed with historical facts, this is the place for you.\n\nImportant notes:\n1. Have a meal before you head over so that you will have patience to enjoy each painting or artifact.\n2. Get the audio guide. (50,000, you can get one and share it by putting your phone on speaker).\n3. Save at least 90 - 120mins to explore.\n4. Bring a bottle of water.\n\nThis is a good time to visit this museum as they are having a Japanese doll exhibition too.\n\nMAKE ART, NOT WAR 🎨",

I think when most people think of fine arts, we think of the masterpieces of the western Old Masters like Rembrandt, stunning paintings on canvas. But the moment you enter here, you are treated to a surprise—elaborate sculptures cut from rock meant to adorn pagodas, wooden painted buddhas larger than life, and the most enthralling lacquer paintings filled with more detail than a where’s waldo page. And yes there are plenty of incredible paintings in oil in the western style, but the plethora of these other works in other mediums created a shift in my mind: fine arts is not limited to the Western ideals. Was really eye-opening for me. The museum is also much bigger than it initially seems. Good choice for a rainy day in Hanoi.",

I love to take my time and try to immerse myself in the multitude of worlds the artists have created and also try to put myself in their shoes - how it must’ve been for them during the creation process. Truly fascinating artworks. I could and should’ve spent the whole day there. Next time! My friend and I didn’t know it already closes at 5pm - we didn’t pay attention to the closing time. That’s what I’d recommend for you guys in the future - come earlier in the morning if you can! Then you can all the time of the world for the day and maybe even find time to do some output while getting so much input. Writing, sketching, drawing… one thing that annoyed me a bit was the massive amount of people in “beautiful” clothes that intend to be there to take an endless of amount of photos. It kind of does distract the moment of appreciation for art when those people take photos for such shallow reasons. But well, we live in that kind of time period now.",

The museum has some nice artifacts and antiques mainly from the recent years. A very big section is dedicated to the civil war. A lot of student are in the museum creating there own work. Generally it’s a nice experience for the whole family.",

The museum consists of two buildings connected with 3 floors on each side and a basement area.  The basement consisted  of interesting ceramics.  There were items from the 10th through the 16th century that were well preserved. Some were made of wood.  The sections I found stunningly beautiful were paintings on silk and those made with lacquer.  I watch a film on the process of using lacquer to create.  It takes time and much work to use this art form.  I appreciated the work much more. I loved the woodcuts and modern art.  There is information in english, but I to me, the audioguide was very helpful.  Once you finish the museum, you can cross the street to visit a temple.  I spent over three hours because there were so many beautiful pieces.",

Neatly and tastefully maintained garden park complex. Tranquility and relaxation, lots of greenery, authentic ponds and buildings, a temple full of well-being and pleasant smells.\n\nIt's make sense since they are used for student who need studying at quiet areas with ancient trees and trimmed lawns, where scholars would relax away from the bustle of the outside world. In ancient it used to be common to rub the stone turtles' heads, but now there is a fence that is meant to prevent people from doing this in order to preserve the turtles. wich honour talent and encourage study.",

It is one of the country's most important educational and architectural sites.\n\nOriginally built in 1070 during the reign of Emperor Ly Thanh Tong, the Temple of Literature was Vietnam's first national university. It was dedicated to Confucius and honored scholars and literary achievements. Over the centuries, the temple underwent various expansions and renovations, becoming a complex of buildings and courtyards.\n\nThe main features of the Temple of Literature include the Great Gate, the Courtyard of the Sage, the Well of Heavenly Clarity, the House of Ceremonies, and the Temple itself. The architecture is influenced by traditional Vietnamese design, with beautiful gardens, pavilions, and statues.\n\nToday, the Temple of Literature serves as a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Hanoi's rich history and intellectual heritage. It also hosts the annual Vietnamese National University Entrance Examination, reflecting its ongoing connection to education.\n\nVisitors can explore the temple grounds, admire the ancient architecture, and learn about Vietnam's scholarly past. The site is particularly busy during the graduation season when students come to seek good luck and blessings for their future academic endeavors.",

You can get an audio guide in your preferred language for 50k each. We ended up hiring an English tour guide for 200k and the two were lasted 1 hour. It was well worth it. Our guide was phenomenal and very patient with all of our questions. I don't think we would have had the same experience without her. I was really wonderful to learn about past and current emphasis on morality and their education and to get contacts of why so many students will come and rub the heads of the turtle statues ( even though they're protected now and not supposed to be disturbed). Even while we were there, there were parents picking up their little kids and telling them to run up and touch the turtles' heads. The rest of the buildings have interesting history. There is a section of one of the main buildings that is set up more like a Temple where some come to worship, but mostly this is a museum in full of historical facts. All of my kids were impressed and enjoyed the whole tour. My kids are ages 8 all the way up to 15.",

What was memorable was knowing that reforming oneself preceded learning something new. And the of course the high esteem that knowledge demanded. But the latter might be a bit biased from my side",

Experience the dedication and the spirit of Vietnamese people in learning and education.\n\nIt is a common practice in Hanoi for graduating students to visit the Temple and offer their prayers.\n\nThe place offers an audio guide, however, the headphones provided do not cover the ear and cannot block outside noise, so I couldn't hear much of the guide. 😞 But from what I could hear, Vietnam has a rich history in Confucionism. They honored their scholars, and every part of the temple teaches the basic principles of education and the discipline required for it.\n\nIt was a very soulful experience, despite the failure of the audio guide to reduce outside noise.\n\nThe souvenir shop beside the exit also has products made by local Vietnamese artists, so be sure to visit it. :)",

There’s lots of flowers and a pond to look at with some fish in it. Overall, I would recommend! It’s a quick visit but could also be a nice spot to stop and read or relax. I would also recommend touring around the entire lake itself :)",

Two real models of the turtles which were previously living in the lake were on display here. Apparently they managed to preserved the bodies after they had passed on. Pretty interesting though.",

Situated on a small island in the picturesque Hoan Kiem Lake, the temple seemed to exude an aura of tranquility and spirituality.\n\nStepping through the entrance gate, I was greeted by the sight of ancient trees, serene courtyards, and ornate pagodas. The scent of burning incense lingered in the air, mingling with the soft sound of chanting from nearby worshipers.\n\nMaking my way through the temple complex, I marveled at the intricate details of the architecture and the centuries-old artifacts on display. Each corner seemed to hold a piece of history, telling the stories of generations past and the cultural heritage of Vietnam.\n\nReaching the heart of Ngoc Son Temple, I stood before the altar, offering my respects to the deities and ancestors honored within. The flickering candlelight cast a warm glow over the sacred space, filling me with a sense of peace and reverence.\n\nAs I wandered around the temple, I couldn\'t help but recall the legendary tale of the revered turtles of Hoan Kiem Lake. According to local folklore, the lake was once home to a giant turtle known as "Cu Rua," which was said to be over six centuries old. Cu Rua was considered a symbol of longevity, wisdom, and good fortune for the Vietnamese people.\n\nLeaving the temple grounds, I felt a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to experience such a sacred place and to reflect on the rich history and cultural significance of Ngoc Son Temple and the legendary turtles of Hoan Kiem Lake.',

                                   "A Historic Glimpse\nBach Ma Temple is a fascinating piece of Hanoi's history. As one of the city’s oldest temples, it's definitely worth a visit for any history buff or curious traveler. While its historical significance is undeniable, don't expect a grand, sprawling complex. It's a smaller temple, but its charm lies in its simplicity and the rich stories it holds.\nConveniently located amidst other historical sites, Bach Ma Temple is a quick and free stop on your Hanoi itinerary. It offers a peaceful respite from the bustling city and a chance to connect with the city’s past.\n* Overall: ★★★\n* Historical Significance: ★★★★\n* Atmosphere: ★★★\n* Value: ★★★★★",

That's why it touched me so deeply 🥺 I spent more than 2-2,5 hours visiting, feeling  in this museum 🤍 The 3rd floor gives me very strong emotions, I am still under its influence. I was crying while listening what they did in the war. Getting to know Vietnamese heroines through the struggles of the American war and the French colony gave me goosebumps. Sending secret messages with scarves, women who joined the front at the age of 14-16, female soldiers, doctors, nurses who were ambushed and killed.. In Vietnam, women are very dominant in fashion, family structure and beliefs. An amazing museum. If you want to feel and really understand, you should get an audio guide.",

To anyone of mildly feminist sensibilities, this might seem like a questionable choice of topics. To be fair however, the 'Family' section is entirely (!) about planting and harvesting rice. 'Women in History' covers the period 1933-1975 and is nearly exclusively about women fighting and killing Americans. To be fair, there is a small section titled \"Destiny of Today's Women\" which mentions jobs available to women and a number of very capitalist success stories of female entrepreneurs.

A few buildings containing relevant historical stuff. Plenty to photograph.\n\nRecommended if you're in the area, but not worth a trip alone.\n\nJust 33 pence entrance fee!  (10,000 dong)",

Dated to the 11th century, the temple was dedicated to Xuan Wu, or Trấn Vũ (chữ Hán: 鎮武) in Vietnamese, one of the principal deities in Taoism. As one of the Four Sacred Temples of the capital, Quan Thánh Temple is located near West Lake in a ward of the same name: Quán Thánh Ward; and is one of the leading tourist attractions in Hanoi. The temple's name means Place (alternatively shop/restaurant) of the Gods. The name of the long street running by the temple is also called 'Quán Thánh' street.\nLegend has it that Quán Thánh Temple was established during the reign of Emperor Lý Thái Tổ (reigned 1010–1028) and was dedicated to Trấn Vũ, Deity of the North in Taoism, whose symbols of power are the serpent and turtle (see section on Animal Symbolism below).It is one of the Four Sacred Temples that were built in four directions to protect the capital from malevolent spirits. Quán Thánh protects from the North, while the other three temples protect from the other directions: Bạch Mã from the East, Kim Liên from the South, and Voi Phục from the West.] In Hanoi, there is also a second Trấn Vũ Temple in the Gia Lâm District. Though smaller than Quán Thánh Temple, this smaller temple is also dedicated to Trấn Vũ with a 9-tonne statue of the deity.",

                                   "Nice and peaceful place\n\nGo to Quan Thanh, a famous temple located on West Lake. The temple worships Thanh Huyen Thien Tran Vu, the god who governs the North and helps people exorcise evil spirits, ghosts, monsters... To this day, there is still a statue of the Saint cast in black bronze in the 2nd year of Vinh Tri (1677).. The statue is 3m96 high, weighs 4 tons, and is a unique work of art by Vietnamese artisans 3 centuries ago. In 2016, the Prime Minister signed a decision to recognize Huyen Thien Tran Vu statue as a national treasure. Inside, there are still many precious artifacts such as ancient bronze lamps and bronze lamps cast in the 17th and 18th centuries...\n\nOn January 18, 2022, the Prime Minister signed Decision No. 93/QD-TTg recognizing Quan Thanh Temple as a special national monument",

Shuffle south to the corner of Hang Bong and Duong Thanh streets for a barbecue meat feast eaten at pavement-scraping plastic tables (from £3).

A bit dirty though, which depends on the time when you want to hang out there.\n\nOtherwise a great spot for tourists as well as locals. Definitely worth going there.",

Supposedly the beer is brewed the same day, without preservatives, and has to be consumed that day.\n\nIt's a very light beer, but nice and refreshing. Highly recommend indulging in this little bit of Hanoi beer culture",

This did not include phones but I am not sure where they draw the line.\n\nI don't think museum is an accurate description of this place as it is more a collection of things from majority the Vietnam war. Very little effort goes into explaining anything and displaying it any meaningful way.\n\nWith so much history we can learn from I wish they did a better job of accurately presenting this.\n\nAlso, just as a side note the toilets here are the worst I've seen in South East Asia. It seems they haven't been cleaned for months.",

This history related to these weapons ( and it's characteristics ) is adequately explained, both in English and the local language, and one can also find references to the Vietnam ( or American ) War here.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a big and old Soviet jet as well as a tank kept on display, and as one goes ahead there are samples of bombs of various sizes kept apart from the bomb releasing machines, which were used during the war, and some of which were unearthed later in the century at various places across the country.\n\nDo note that the Museum is closed on Mon and Fri, and also during 11:30 am to 1:00 pm. I couldn't get the time to see the second building. This is also the only entry point to the Flag Tower. If one loves museums, it's unlikely that the whole museum can be seen in one visit, and will likely require two visits given the time constraints.\n\nThe museum should consider remaining open till 6 pm ( as opposed to 4:30 pm currently ) or so and/or not closing for the mid-duration of 2hrs. The entry fee is VND 40,000, and there is a coffee machine near the entry and also a restaurant inside.",

Most of the signs have English, but the audiovisuals are in Vietnamese only.\n\nUnfortunately, the last exhibit featuring the history from 1975-2011 is quite remote (at the back of the complex) and was closed during my visit.",

They’re not there anymore.\nIt seems there is a new museum being built somewhere where they will all go and all that equipment has been stored in the mean time. Information was hard to gather, but that’s what I have. The remaining small items clothes, firearms, etc are okay. The flag tower is cool. And the rubble of ex-planes is artistic in a eashhh kind of way. It’s hard to complain for 30,000 dong. But unless you haven’t been to other war museums in SE Asia, it’s not overly different. Although Vietnam history buffs may like it, but be prepared for….slight to not slight propaganda, biased signage and displays set up by people who may not have actual military experience 😁, no matter what you think of the war itself. But it’s all part of the experience I guess.\nThe morale of the story is, don’t take your 5 year old boy whom you’ve been promising tanks and planes for a week. Quite sad, plus he had trouble understanding how they even got the tanks out since they’re so heavy!🤣",

Redaria, a second-year university student with good English,  toured us at the Vietnam Military History Museum and the Hoa Lo Prison. She narrated the stories with so much passion and  vision. Understanding the past is key to the future - this adage could not be more true for Vietnam. Despite its thousand-year war-torn past with diff foreign super-powers, the Vietnamese embrace all former foes as friends today. History has taught an entire people the value of peace through forgiveness in order to thrive and prosper.  Isn’t this what the world needs today?",

The most disappointing aspect of this visit was the rude staff at the ticket booth—she essentially was not having a good day. There were two parties ahead of me in the queue: a Vietnamese couple and a German couple. The female staff at the ticket booth acted dismissive and annoyed when issuing the tickets with German couple and then myself. She threw at me the ticket and the change. The male in the Vietnamese couple for whatever reason was pretty rude, giving stares, rolling his eyes at westerners and walking in front of us as we were visiting the rooms, mind you that there was plenty of space around but he purposeful would invade others’ personal space and laugh as if his intention was to trigger others to engage—the woman with him looked notably ashamed. Not a reflection of Viet people’s behavior toward westerners (at least from my experience), and perhaps just some self-selection bias into who comes to this type of museum. I was excited to visit this museum to learn narratives that are often not told in the west about the Vietnam war;  but my experience was just overshadowed by the rude staff and the local visitor’s attitude and behavior.",

If you have an interest in gaining a deeper understanding of history, I would recommend allocating around 1-1.5 hours for your visit.\n\nOn a less positive note, I encountered an issue with the security guard at the entrance. Upon stepping in and taking a quick look around for just a few seconds, the guard shouted at me in a loud and rude manner, insisting that I purchase a ticket. It would have been appreciated if he had approached the situation with a calmer demeanor. After all, I was there to enjoy my visit and relax in the city. It's important to remember that as a visitor, I don't work for the museum or the guard. Nonetheless, I found the situation somewhat amusing and shared a lighthearted response with him.\n\nDespite the encounter with the security guard, the military museum itself offers a valuable experience, providing in-depth insights into history.

                                   "Stepping into the Vietnam National Museum of History, I embarked on a journey through the rich tapestry of Vietnam's past. Each exhibit, meticulously curated and thoughtfully presented, offered a glimpse into the nation's storied history and cultural heritage.\n\nAs I wandered through the halls, I was struck by the resilience and strength of the Vietnamese people in the face of adversity. From the struggles against foreign colonization to the trials of war and conflict, the museum's exhibits illuminated the triumphs and tribulations of generations past.\n\nOne exhibit, in particular, left a profound impact on me. It chronicled the human cost of war, showcasing artifacts and personal stories that spoke to the courage and sacrifice of those who fought and perished in defense of their homeland. Standing before the relics of a bygone era, I was overwhelmed by a wave of emotion, my heart heavy with sorrow for the lives lost and the suffering endured.\n\nYet, amidst the darkness of war and conflict, there were also moments of hope and resilience. Another exhibit celebrated the vibrant cultural heritage of Vietnam, showcasing traditional arts, crafts, and customs passed down through generations. Here, I found solace in the beauty and richness of the country's cultural legacy, a testament to the enduring spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nLeaving the museum, I couldn't shake the weight of the experience from my mind. It was a poignant reminder of the fragility of peace and the resilience of the human spirit. But above all, it was a call to action, urging me to remember the lessons of the past and strive for a future of peace, understanding, and reconciliation.",

There are two separate buildings and one is for the ancient Vietnam exhibits (which is pretty impressive) and the other is for post-1945 Vietnam (French revolution, etc).\n\nThey have a vast collection of pre-historic artifacts dating back to the Stone Age; it’s obvious that Vietnam has excellent archeological efforts.\n\nThese are really old buildings built during the French rule so it’s a bit creepy walking around dark corridors and spaces, and some areas aren’t well-ventilated, although I think it adds to the experience while looking at ancient mystic objects, i felt like it added to the thrill..:)\n\nOverall, a must-visit if you like history and art.

Google maps will direct you to the building about modern Vietnamese history, but to go in chronological order you need to go across the road to the other building to start with prehistoric Vietnam. I’ve included a photo of the correct building to start at below.\n\nOther than that, the museum is OK. The prehistory room was very good, but once I got to the room about Chinese influence and the development of Vietnam as a country, the descriptions and explanations became very confusing and it was really hard to tell what the items on display showed.

The struggles they went through were just insane.\n\nThe items in the museum have been looked after and are in such great condition. Just loved the old school cupboards with the mother of pearls. The mesuem also offers audio files for each of the pieces so make sure to take some headphones to listen.\n\nThe meusem area is very large and open. It is both child friendly as well as caiters for people with disabilities.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting the natural History museum.",

If you value quality, please think twice before dining here.\n\nThe fish served was of very low quality, likely leftover from previous guests. We were shocked by the high prices considering the poor quality of the food. When we arrived with three people, we were not provided with a menu. Instead, they brought us a set dish called Cha Ca. We expected it to be delicious, but unfortunately, the smell was off-putting from the first bite.\n\nDespite our hopes for improvement with a second attempt, the taste remained unpleasant. Ultimately, we couldn't finish our meal and left most of it untouched, yet we still paid the full price of 550,000 VND.\n\nI hope this helps you make an informed decision. Safe travels!",

Waiter was rude and didn’t tell us how to do the cha ca and got annoyed when we were asking questions about what to cook or how to make the dish correctly. Fish was okay but overall flavour very bland and was not worth the money. Ignore the other reviews it’s clear they’re all fake as all posted the same date and all of them only have written one review!",

The que system was exceptionally organized.\n\nRecommend covering Shoulders and knees if you are to visit the main man himself. If not you’ll get rejected before security. At the check they take any liquids, you get a blue bag with you deliver, get a note and pick up at exit. Also no camera equipment allowed, you a get a red bag for the camera and do the same, just a little later down the line.\n\nWhen you get close to the end you’ll get yelled at if you use the phone, and they are pretty strict on no phones.\n\nInside the mausoleum was incredible. Just have to experience it, we felt it well worth the visit, ecpesially on his birthday 19. May\n\nHad to buy cover ups for our knees, but other than that is was free entry to the mausoleum, afterwords it’s 40k entry per person to see the presidential palace and such",

Make sure you dress appropriately or you won\'t be allowed in; no shorts and wear long sleeves. This building is austere and imposing, it commands your respect and reverence. Entering the chamber you must continue moving around the three sides on silence. His body is amazingly preserved and clearly viewed through the glass sided coffin. Four guards stand motionless in their pristine white uniforms at each corner of the sunken pit where the coffin resides, and another five guards attend the walkway and ensure you keep moving. No headwear allowed in the chamber and obviously no photos/video.',

                                   "It was nice to see the history from a Vietnamese perspective (rather than the western one we were taught in school) and how Ho Chi Minh lived. However we were unaware it closed at 11:00am (nor did they tell us when we got tickets around 10:30) and we were rushed onwards by staff so were not able to spend as much time here as we would have liked. However the price for a ticket is very reasonable (we were able to see the museum next door without paying, so that was kind of the staff, although the museum also closed quite soon after we entered which may have been why we were allowed to go in for free).",

Could be combined with visiting after mausoleum.\nEntrance fee is overtired to my mind. It should be free. A lot of people thus long queues just for watching.",

These are the local places where the food is made by Vietnamese for the Vietnamese.  We walked until we were stuffed with our amazing tour guide. Daisy led us through the bustling streets of Hanoi, and I highly recommend trying to request her if she's available. The food is made better by the company you get to enjoy it with, and she made the experience really fun. Using humor and local knowledge she added to the stories with information on all the foods we ate. I think we may go back again tonight.",

I just finished my meal and it was absolutely delicious. I'm writing this review right now with a full and happy belly.\n\nSecondly, is the tour guide good? Yes, our guide was \"Apple\" and she was awesome. We enjoyed her company and learned about Vietnamese culture through food. It was a great experience…\n\nLastly, is the tour worth it? Absolutely! We didn't have to worry about where we were going or what to do. Apple took care of everything - not only did she choose great dishes, but she also explained how to eat them the right way…to get the full taste.\n\nOverall, we loved the experience and had a wonderful time. The tour took us through winding streets and places we may not have visited. Highly recommended!",

We experienced 8 different dishes at 7 places. Not rushed at all, thoroughly enjoyed our group, host (Sarah) and food venues. We had 3 people with allergies to various kai (myself included) so we didn't experiemce any of the more local delicacies like sand worms (for the adventurous foodie).\n\nMy favs were #1=Bun Cha & sticky rice and Mango. #2 Mien tron (glass noodles)",

We loved being able to try different, authentic foods that we wouldn’t normally go for, or know where to find. Thao’s English was exceptional, and her strive to ensure we had the best time was high. This tour exceeded expectations. Thank you Thao.",

A nicely balanced mix of exotic fruits, savoury and sweet dishes with a few challenges like sandworm pancakes thrown in to take me out of my comfort zone. The tour was well paced and took in a lot of the colour and clamour of the Old Quarter. Great bunch of people to share it with as well.\n\nThe real stand out though was our guide Gerri (sorry if I have the spelling wrong). Super professional, able to accommodate the diverse needs of the group, informative but sensitive to what people wanted. Relaxed and charming.\n\nAll in all, a great introduction to the joys of Hanoi.",

Our guide, Thao, a local born in Hanoi, was the epitome of hospitality and professionalism throughout the entire tour.\n\nFrom the moment we met Thao, her warm demeanor and excellent command of English immediately put us at ease. Not only was she incredibly friendly, but her knowledge of the local cuisine and culture was truly impressive. Thao went above and beyond to ensure that we had an authentic and unforgettable experience.\n\nOne of the highlights of the tour was Thao's attention to detail. Not only did she introduce us to a wide variety of mouthwatering dishes, but she also took the time to meticulously document each one, providing us with a handwritten list of all the delicacies we sampled. Her personalized recommendations for other places to visit during our stay were also greatly appreciated and added immense value to our trip.\n\nThao's passion for her city and its culinary treasures was evident in every aspect of the tour. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her ability to share insights into the history and significance of each dish made the experience both educational and enjoyable.\n\nWe cannot recommend Hanoi Street Food Tour and Thao highly enough. Whether you're a food enthusiast or simply looking to explore the vibrant streets of Hanoi, this tour is an absolute must-do. Thao's hospitality, expertise, and genuine love for her city truly set this experience apart.\n\nThank you Thao!",

We loved everything we tried, but our favorites were the coconut sticky rice ice cream and the sandworm pancake (Cha ruoi). The tour lasted about 2.5 hours, and we were very full by the end. Sarah was so easy to talk to and so friendly. It felt like we got more than a street food tour - we got to learn more about Hanoi and Vietnamese culture. The tour helped familiarize us with how to order at a restaurant and what foods are traditionally eaten. We had an issue with our flight and arrived a day later than expected; because of this we had to change our tour date. They were very accommodating and helpful! Everyone should do this tour when visiting Hanoi!",

It's in the perfect location right in the heart of the city but is a quiet and welcome sanctuary when Hanoi can feel too busy. The staff were superb, friendly and attentive and the food in the restaurant was always excellent. Thanks !",

                                   'Mein Zimmer im Hotel hat mir gut gefallen. Ich konnte auf der Matratze und mit den Kissen wunderbar schlafen, weil es nicht so weich ist, wie in Europa. Das Frühstück hat mir ganz gut gefallen, auch wenn man etwa eine Stunde vor Schluss manchmal keine frischen Gerichte mehr bekommen hat bzw. Dinge nicht nachgefüllt worden sind. Der Standort ist praktisch, um Hanoi zu Fuß zu erkunden, da man in kürzester Zeit am Ho Hoang Kiem See und anderen wichtigen Orten ist. Nicht gefallen hat mir das "Gym". Die Laufbänder sind sehr alt und weder der Ventilator noch die Klimaanlage ließen sich anschalten, sodass das Training bei der Hitze sehr anstrengend gewesen ist.\nAlles in allem kann ich das Hotel jedoch wärmstens empfehlen.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nI liked my room in the hotel. I was able to sleep wonderfully on the mattress and with the pillows because it is not as soft as in Europe. I really liked the breakfast, even if you sometimes didn\'t get any fresh dishes or things weren\'t refilled about an hour before the end. The location is convenient for exploring Hanoi on foot as you can be at Ho Hoang Kiem Lake and other important places in no time. I didn\'t like the "gym". The treadmills are very old and neither the fan nor the air conditioning could be turned on, so training in the heat was very strenuous.\nAll in all, I can highly recommend the hotel.',

I reported that to cleaner. Next day I had to pay for it, and the sum was more than a great quality shorhorn in the west.\n\nThere were also some other points that tells they rather charge you than wants you to come back next time.\n\nAnyway, the hotel is quite nice and the room service is doing pretty well.\n\nBecause of the attitude in Hotel, I need to stress that it is better to be very carefull and to ensure everything.",

The lightening for the room is not yellow) and all are met for me\n\nLocation: 5 mins slow walk away from the lake and street food\n\nService:\nArrived on 10am earlier than the 2pm check in time- allowed us to keep luggage in the hotel while we walk around. Receptionist are able to communicate in english which was life saving\n\nBreakfast:\nSeems like most hotel in hanoi provide breakfast buffets when you booked it, out of the 3 hotels i’ve stayed this is the best breakfast place",

All the tourist places in the old quarter of Hanoi is walkable from this hotel. One can watch opera and come back to the hotel in night without any problem. Lake is also nearby. The restaurant is superb. There is a fitness centre also. The staff in the front desk are really good. There behaviour is strikingly good. They also arrange pick up and drop of service for Airport. The rooms are spacious and with all gadgets like TV, electric kettle and hot water. We were amazed to see the room decor. Excellent facilities. Similarly the Breakfast (complementary) was too good. The restaurant where breakfast being served is also worth mentioning. It is decorated in Victorian style and the atmosphere here helps you to enjoy your food. While returning to India the lady in the counter offered small gifts. I will never forget their hospitality. The hotel will always remain in my memory.",

And I've had a lot.\n\nThe level of customer service/approachability of the team was magnificent. I would say one of the best I've experienced.\n\nThe room was clean, good size, quiet (mostly). The housekeeping staff were great also.\n\nLocation right in the heart of town yet far enough to not be positioned right in the chaotic hustle and bustle of Hanoi.\n\nIf I could have one criticism, I would say the breakfast wasn't as comprehensive as it could have been. However, it wasn't terrible (still 4/5)\n\nIf I visit Hanoi again, I will stay here!",

We dined at the Angelina and Le Beaulieu restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed both. Most of all, we enjoyed the professionalism of the staff. They always brought their A game to their work. Our room was always neat and tidy. This hotel is a masterpiece and I will stay here again when we come back to Hanoi.",

Sofitel Metropole is located in the French quarter of Hanoi only a few minutes walk to beautiful Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the bustling old quarter. Going on leisurely walks nearby the hotel is lovely and relaxing. The rooms were phenomenal, very comfortable and constant room service to keep things clean. They also keep a fresh rose in the room everyday and a macaron every night! The breakfast, lunch and dinner options at the restaurant by the pool was very good too and they offered us complimentary welcome drinks twice. All the hotel staff were incredibly friendly and the service was excellent. It was in fact the most satisfying hotel experience I have had. I hope to stay again at Sofitel Hanoi and could not recommend it more.",

The breakfast was fantastic. The rooms were very elegant but quite tight. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms and the closet door would not even open all the way because it hit into the bed. Our kids stayed across the hall in a twin room which was also tight and had a view of the roof. So pay attention to which category of room you book. We ate in Spice and Angelina restaurants for dinner and both were good. This is an expensive hotel but feels very exclusive and safe. We loved our stay here. The only thing it is missing is a hot tub by the pool, because it was not very hot in Dec and the pool was not heated enough for us. Overall it is a top notch hotel.",

The hospitality here in my view is legendary. The staff is superb, in their competence and care. They are courteous, knowledgeable, helpful without being intrusive, and communicate very well.\n\nThis is truly one of the world‘s greatest and most iconic hotels, both in its history and in the team that currently runs it.

The hotel is one of the most famous and prestigious in Hanoi and it has a rich history.\n\nAs we walked into the hotel, it felt like we were transported back to another era. The hotel has a classic French colonial style, with white walls, green shutters and red tiled roof. The lobby was spacious and elegant with marble floors, chandeliers and antique furniture. Even through we were not hotel guests, the staff were very polite and welcoming. We continued to wander around the hotel to see what it had to offer and were amazed by the variety and quality of the facilities and services. The hotel has a beautiful garden, an outdoor pool, a spa and fitness center and a boutique.  One of the highlights of the hotel has to be its gastronomy. The hotel has several restaurants and bars, each with its own theme and cuisine.\n\nWe had a great time wandering through Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi. The hotel is more than just a place to stay, it is a destination itself, one that we may one day stay at as hotel guests ourselves. It combines the charm and elegance of the past with the comfort and convenience of the present. It is a perfect example of Hanoi's culture, history, and luxury.",

                                   "We just recently stayed for two nights in August and my goodness what a beautiful tranquil gem in a busy Cultural city that is Hanoi. It really brings calm to the end of an adventurous hot humid day. The rooms were so clean and clean ell presented with beautiful decor, bed is so comfortable, had best sleep ever. Then the breakfast was just so incredible with ingredients so fresh and prepared so well that you can taste it.\nNo this is not a paid review either, just an honest one.\nThe dinners were great, even outside on the hotel people watching with a lovely bowl of Pho!\nGreat pool, so clean and so beautiful to swim in at night!\nGreat spa, had a super mummy & daughter treatment. The therapists were so so good.\nThe club benefits with the afternoon tea and evening canopies with champagne and wine is great. A super spread indeed.\nI can’t fault a thing with this beautiful grand hotel and this is from someone who regularly travels in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia staying in 5 star luxury. This place met and exceeded expectations! I will be back",

                                   "A historical landmark and hospitality flagship in Hanoi.\n\nThe hotel is everything a 5 star property should be like. We stayed twice during a family vacation in December in two separate rooms.\n\nHighlights:\n- Amazing breakfast (tip: go to the covered greenhouse). Not only is there a great variety of items, but they are all of great quality, which is not always the case in hotels. Great mix between local flair and western products, with attentive service and quality which can be perceived even in the tablecloths and napkins used. Only suggestion to elevate it even more would be to have a live fruit juice station available To highlight the amazing local fruit varieties\n- Turndown service: replenishing of glass water bottles (plus in sustainability there), laying of slippers and hands down some of the best macarons!\n- Attentive and discreet service\n\nFor next time:\n- Front office had run out of local currency when we asked to exchange money\n- The building is a historical landmark in Hanoi and the decor highlights it, as it should. However, I believe there is an opportunity to make the reception/ front office area more impressive and generate a greater “wow” factor that enhances the property’s uniqueness\n\nWould definitely return!",

The staff here is incredibly kind, knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms we got a great deal by going with an agency for a better price then Agoda, etc. Food is on point, you won’t be disappointed! The customer service level here goes just as far if not further than European countries and the USA. If you are not staying here, at lease come look at the history of this hotel and check out the restaurant and bar. Last but not least, this location is CENTRAL and close to everything.",

                                   "Like others mentioned, this historic hotel has good location. Breakfast is amazing but paying over $600 a night for 3 persons for club level room is not worth it. Service was not consistent and while staff was polite, they did not seem to be warm or sincere. We had a minor issue which needed to be clarified. It was addressed early in the morning but we didn’t get the answer until late afternoon after 3 stops at the front desk since “the manager is not here”. Pillows, comforter and sheets are high end and comfortable. They attached all the bath products to the wall which is okay but for the lotion is a bit inconvenient since you have to go the bathroom when you need it. It's also annoying that it's so hard to press the pump and you have to press it several times to get enough amount of shampoo or bath gel for each shower. I understand it's Balmain products but it's kinda cheesy for a 5 star hotel.\nOverall I think this hotel is a bit overrated",

The storied property is impeccable and ideally situated in the heart of Hanoi. We looked forward to the delicious breakfast spread every morning, and relished the poolside cocktails in the afternoons. The concierge service was valuable, and the warm greetings from the staff at every turn made us feel special and welcomed. The spa treatment was soothing, and the macarons left at turn down were the perfect way to finish off our night. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer. Hopefully, we'll be back.",

The hotel is an architectural masterpiece, that stands as a beacon of French elegance and Vietnamese culture.  My wife was on a medical mission in Hanoi and I was left alone at the Metropole working remotely.  The Metropole became my sanctuary - I could have stayed here forever.\n\nThe hotel is a Grand Hotel but it's just right - not too big but big enough to have everything you want. Great spa, five fantastic restaurants, a gym, a pool and so many quiet spots to sit and read or work.  You feel the spirits of all the luminaries that have stayed here - Charlie Chaplin, Somerset Maugham, and Graham Greene are a few. And you sense the pivotal moments of history that have occurred (and still occur) at this hotel - it has a profound sense of place.\n\nThe staff cherishes the Hotel's history and prominence and they provide a sense of warm caring hospitality that is unmatched.  Attentive, professional, and friendly but again dignified and reserved - in no way overbearing.  I will go back next year and look forward to staying at the Metropole - so many great stories that I want to make this hotel a part of my story.",

                                   "We stayed in two different historic wing room categories during two stays within days of one another. They were both beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean.\n\nOur interactions with the hotel staff were always friendly, sincere and effective. There is a sense that this is a good place to work and that the staff are happy to be there.\n\nWe enjoyed our time at the hotel immensely.\n\nFrom the airport transfers, to the food on offer for breakfast lunch and dinner, the well managed pool and the fun bamboo bar, we couldn’t have been happier with our stay.\n\nThe only constructive feedback would be that our second room, which we stayed in on the second of our two stays (room 237) had less effective air conditioning than our first room (room 305).",

I have been here with my family 2 times already and haven’t had a complaint yet about this place. The staff is incredibly well trained and charming. The pool is a perfect place to have an early morning or nights swim. I want to give a personal shout out to the staff at the pooI and spice garden for making our breakfast memorable! will be back soon for more!",

The staff made our stay extra special by preparing welcoming gifts - a framed photo of our engagement which they got from our social media, a teddy bear with a hand written note, a cake with a message written in icing and an origami ring. The A La Carte breakfast menu is excellent and we had it every day, the thick cut bacon and Ricotta pancakes are delicious. The staff are really generous and kind and will help with any request.",

                                   "This is a reasonably interesting museum with artifacts found throughout Vietnam, some of which date back 4000 years and most have descriptions in Vietnamese, English and French.  The layout and displays are a little dated and I would like to have seen more information about some of the artifacts.  We spent less than 2 hours here and saw all that was on display, the entrance fee is very cheap so good value for money.  Like many places in Hanoi they close for a very long lunch, so check the opening times before heading this way.",

                                   'The first building was amazing. It shows the history (and prehistoric) of Vietnam. The first floor seems to be organized by timeline. The second floor was housing Cham Sculpture and a more recent like 18th-19th century collection.\n\nThe Cham culture display is kind of scatterred without proper timeline and explanation as compared to "Cham museum" in Da Nang.\n\nThe second building was about the time before the abdication of the kingdom until the vietnam war over. It has almost 25 rooms if i\'m not mistaken but it would be better if there\'s a "Theme and timeline" placard instead of "number" placard. So people are more intrigued by the stuff because they know the outline. Cause most people just scanned the room and some deterred to explore more because we need to read all the stuff to know.',

Took us 45 minutes. The lake is large. Couldn’t see the other side. It was mid-morning and hazy. We walked along the lake. So many people walking around as well. Some parts sparse. No shortage of things to do and see. You can bike around, do water activities, stop in for coffee or a bite to eat. We went a few streets back and found a place to eat. There were men throwing their lines in the water, fishing. We did see dead fish and plastics along parts of the lake sadly, but still a good day out.",

When you go to West Lake, you will have some beautiful photos. There're a lot of pretty coffee shops and restaurants thereabouts, both casual and fine dinnings, most of them serve Western cuisine.

                                   'West Lake (Vietnamese: Hồ Tây) is the biggest freshwater lake of Hanoi, Vietnam, located northwest of the city center. With a shore length of 17 kilometres (11 mi) and 500 hectares (5.0 km2) in area, this is the largest lake of the capital and a popular place for recreation with many surrounding gardens, hotels and villas. A small part of West Lake is divided by Thanh Niên road to form Trúc Bạch Lake. Most of the lake is located within Tây Hồ District, named after the lake.\nWest Lake was created from a curved part of Red River and appeared in several Vietnamese legends. One legend suggests that West Lake was shaped after the battle between Lạc Long Quân and a hồ tinh (nine-tailed fox), and that\'s why the lake was once called "Fox Corpse Swamp" (Đầm Xác Cáo). Another folk story claimed that original name of the lake was "Golden Buffalo Lake" (Hồ Trâu Vàng, or Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary: Hồ Kim Ngưu) because it was formed from struggle of a buffalo after the disappearance of her calf. In the 11th century, the lake was named "Foggy Lake" (Hán Việt: Hồ Dâm Đàm) due to its misty condition. Ultimately its name was changed to "West Lake" in 1573 to avoid the given name of Emperor Lê Thế Tông, which was Duy Đàm.\nWest Lake is bordered by many significant places in the history of Hanoi and Vietnam. Trấn Quốc Pagoda, an ancient Buddhist temple in Vietnam,[1] was built in the 6th century by Emperor Lý Nam Đế and is located on a small island in the middle of the lake. Near Trấn Quốc Pagoda is Quán Thánh Temple, one of the Four Sacred Temples of ancient Hanoi (Vietnamese: Thăng Long Tứ Trấn). Chu Văn An High School, one of the oldest high schools in Vietnam, is also located close to the lake.',

We visited for lunch and were impressed by the enticing set menu options. The bold flavors, seasonings, and ingredients are expertly combined, resulting in a semi-gastronomic experience (from my point of view) — arguably on a gastronomic level compared to the overall F&B scene in Hanoi.\n\nWhile the drink selection is excellent, it is worth noting that, as is common in Vietnam, the drinks tend to be overly sweetened.",

The taste of the pumpkin soup was exquisite and the foie gras was a great start but the best was yet to come. Salad was really fresh with a refreshing dressing, the salmon with mashed potato and the pink gravy was amazing. It was such a perfect lovely meal with the dessert to complete the lunch. I’ve never had such a satisfying meal in a very very long time. Definitely exceeding my expectations. Every dish amazed me and I could tell they pay meticulous attention to every single ingredient served. I was so happy and went back for dinner on the same day too. Service was great, welcoming and attentive even during full house. As a Michelin guide restaurant, no doubt they totally live up to the reputation.",

Every course surprised us and tantalised our taste buds. Very well put menu that alternates between explosive and subtle as the courses went on. The main course which was the tenderloin was made to perfection with a very good combo of risotto & mushroom.\n\nOverall, it’s a lovely place and will definitely recommend 💯💯\n\nBest Regards,\nMelissa from Malaysia",

                                   "We got there quite late without a reservation. After a 15 minutes wait, they managed to accommodate us at a table upstairs. The attentiveness of the waitresses were impressive.  I think they noticed that we were keen to be seated downstairs where the string quartet was and without us asking, they offered to switch us when a table became available. After our first course, we were promptly whisked to the main dining hall. The ambience is definitely much better here. I loved the high ceiling and interesting locals framed prints. The string quartet was amazing. The food was excellent. Every course was prepared and presented meticulously. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",

Every dish was thoughtful and each element complemented another perfectly.\n\nI would like to praise the excellent service to the team particularly.  I casually mentioned the meal was to celebrate Mother’s Day in advance as I live overseas and don’t see my mom often.  Chef surprised us with a yummy dessert and wrote in chocolate ‘Happy Mother’s Day’ on the plate.  Mom was overjoyed.",

We also massively enjoyed the string quartet, which plays on Wednesday night. The Four Seasons suite was the highlight but they also played fun pop songs, and show tunes. I drank Pino Grigio which was delicious. They included a special message for our honeymoon. The service was immaculate. Yes, this is expensive by Hanoi standards, but very well worth the experience. Highly recommended.",

                                   "We chose this place to celebrate my birthday while on vacation in Hanoi, and we were seated at a lovely and secluded table. The staff went the extra mile to decorate the table with rose petals and candles. We both opted for the course menu, trying both the signature course and the fusion course. Although there weren't significant differences between the two, there were some minor changes, such as variations in the sauces.\n\nThe first and second courses were delightful, and we thoroughly enjoyed them. However, the foie gras was average. For the main course, I requested a change, as I don't eat beef. Unfortunately, they only allowed us to select an item from the à la carte menu instead of providing an alternative within the course menu. I chose the fish dish and the fish itself was well-cooked, but I personally didn't enjoy the crumbs on top of it. The dessert was delicious, but the portion size was quite large.\n\nThere was live music during our dinner, although they were playing too much upbeat music, making it a bit distracting.\n\nThe staff members were all incredibly friendly and helpful. When we finished dinner, it was raining heavily, and they kindly assisted us in arranging a taxi despite several cancellations from drivers. They even escorted us to the car with umbrellas.\n\nOverall, I would say the food was good, although there is room for improvement in the main course, and the ambiance could be enhanced (perhaps by implementing a dress code). The service was excellent, and overall, it was a pleasant experience for my birthday celebration.",

Like people have said in the reviews. The burgers were amazing, Big and juicy, and the fries were so good. Now every other place is better. They d not even use real bacon anymore. They have turkey bacon. Horrible. Yes news is on and the walls are horrible. I give it two stars for one for not being the same. Shameless serving of horrible fries. Bad bacon. Small chicken. And the burger taste somewhat filled with water. Had no taste at all. If you read this please skip this place. I should of read reviews before coming. Win some lose some. But this place is no even close to being more than a two star. Even complaining about fries I still never got any. And to top it. I believe the food went up in price. Horrible burger day.",

More a burger stand. Friendly service.\nOrdered Tracy's Damn Good Burger.\nI was not asked how I like burger, so I assumed it would come to me in the standard cooked.\nBit in to raw meat....I told them that the burger was not cooked. One of the guys asked me if I had wanted it medium rare.\nNobody asked. Please remake.\nThey slipped the already topped burger patty out from the burger, slapped it back on the grill, and set the plate aside.\nEvery place I've ever been to remakes the whole burger. (Health & Safety concerns you see)\nWhen I got my plate back, the burger was soggy and the fries were cold.\nHUGE TURN OFF.\nI don't know why this place got so many good ratings. Did I catch them on a bad day?\nI will NOT go back.\nThere are much better burger places in Hanoi.\n6/10",

With a cozy vibe and good view of the Truc Bach lake, this one is a perfect choice for dinner.\n\nIn terms of their food, we ordered a typical Vietnamese meals and you can see in the picture ( we ordered vegetable soup as well but it came later so I didn’t take a pic). I would say I didn’t feel like I was eating out at all, all the food were great and comforting. I highly recommend you to try the stir fried water spinach with garlic and fried chicken with fish sauce.\n\nTheir staffs are pretty nice and can communicate in English so it would be a plus😎",

I see from previous reviews that this is not the first rat sighting in this restaurant so I would recommend people steer clear. Thankfully they allowed me to cancel my order after I questioned their hygiene standards. While the shop has a cute concept, the food is expensive (dishes more than 100k VND) and they do not serve single serving meals like pho. Unless you are coming in a group, it will be difficult to order.",

                                   "I regret having to write this review for a restaurant which has, in the past, been one of my go-tos for when friends and family come to visit Hanoi.\n\nThe quality of service at this restaurant has declined significantly, to the point where the staff actively ignore customers and behave incredibly rudely to them.\n\nBefore I ordered, I and my partner overheard a customer arguing with the staff about how long it took to get the bill. At the time, overhearing this, we assumed that the customer was being unreasonable. However, we later realized that the service at the restaurant was terrible.\n\nDuring the meal, the service was so so. A few things on the menu were missing and they brought us the wrong items from the menu. Not a big deal. However, when we had finished eating, I asked for the bill. All three waiters were on their phones and two of them had their headphones in. One of them acknowledged me, so I decided to wait. 5 minutes passed and he still hadn't moved, so I asked for the bill again. He again nodded to me, showing that he heard me, but he still didn't move and continued to play games on his phone. At this point, two members of staff were sitting opposite each other, playing games on their phones and drinking milk tea. Finally, after almost 15m of waiting (the restaurant was not at all busy) I decided to go to the counter and just wait there until I got the bill. When I got there, a different staff member came out from the kitchen and served me. The waiter who I had previously asked the bill from was still sitting there playing on his phone. I told him that the level of service was really unprofessional and he didn't even look at me, he simply mumbled something under his breath. I then paid and left.\n\nI have been to this restaurant maybe 10 times over 4 years and will never go back. Because I really like the food and decor of the place, I tried to be patient with the staff and to be understanding. However, I cannot believe the level of contempt that the staff treat the customers with and I will never go back to this place again. A real shame as I have previously been such a fan.",

Chim Sao has all good northern Vietnamese dishes and they are really tasty too.\n\nThe bathroom is a bit messy and dirty but that is common in Hanoi.\n\nWe went to this restaurant with 2 persons and ordered 4 dishes. We got a lot of food. I think that a person can eat 1 dish each best so to taste everything it is better to come in a bigger group",

We asked the waiter in english the size of the portion and hinted its quite small. And it was a mistake to order too many dishes and couldn't finish them at all. Think 3 to 4 dishes would be enough for 2 adults. We ordered 6 dishes.\nThe taste of the food... I'm not sure how to describe it since I didn't know what to expect. Its pretty rustic no frill cooking. Some dishes were blend and some dishes tasted vinegar sour that didn't go well with the ingredients.\nBut it was a fun experience tasting other food items than pho, Banh mi, Bun Cha and Banh xeo. I'd say 3.5 stars",

We didn’t love the fried fish roles… the stuffing was unusual and lacked the quintessential Vietnamese aromatic herbs. The stuffed squid was better, really well-cooked but the stuffing could have been more interesting. The smoked duck was a stand out…. Luscious and super tasty. Enjoyed the rice wine. The prices are quite dear but unfortunately they do take credit card.",

It is located so close to the railway track that when you sip in either a beer or whiskey or anything drink and you suddenly see the train very nearby, then it  means a whole new different world all together. It has very small seating capacity. But even then it is a once in a lifetime experience for all of you that are planning to visit Hanoi and want to have some drinks.\n\nFrom food and drinking perspective as well they have authentic Vietnamese cuisines along with the their local craft beers and lots more. It is a must visit place.",

                                   "Located directly on the train tracks, Ray Quan is a quirky spot in the heart of Vietnam that offers a truly unique dining experience. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's a must-visit for those seeking an unconventional adventure in dining. Ray Quan serves up an array of mouthwatering Vietnamese dishes prepared to order, along with a special homemade rice wine that's sure to delight your taste buds. Ray Quan tantalizes with a  array of fusion rice wine, meticulously crafted to order, and boasts a secret weapon – their homemade rice wine, an experience so divine it's practically mandatory to indulge in their rice wine taster flight. Brace yourself; it's a wild ride, but the flavors are nothing short of extraordinary. My favorite discoveries are : Apricot, Passion and green pepper.\n\nWhat sets Ray Quan apart from your typical restaurant is its location – right on the train tracks. The atmosphere is buzzing with excitement as you dine inches away from passing trains. The thrill of feeling the vibrations as a train passes by adds a unique charm to the dining experience. It's a must-try for those looking to explore local flavors. The owner and his partner are friendly and more than willing to help you navigate the menu if you're unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nOverall, Rai Quan is a hidden gem in the heart of Vietnam that offers an unforgettable drinking and dining experience. Just remember to check the train schedule to time your visit for an extra thrill. Must go when you are in Hanoi.",

Perfect place to have a drink with friends, with the train passing by just in front of you.\nVery typical and great atmosphere! The owners are lovely, and they have original cocktails.",

Then we ordered sweet potatoes with honey glaze, and they brought us regular potatoes with mayo instead. The rice wine is good, but otherwise it’s really not worth it. Our happy hour here cost 1.5x more than our dinner, and we didn’t even get what we ordered",

Also it's pretty exciting when the trains goes right past! Be aware you do have to wander the track for a few metres to get there, so just be careful! Fun place!",

Coming to Hanoi, especially the mural street, tourists can see Hanoi’s symbolic images on the wall such as small grocery stores, women carrying a bamboo yoke of flowers on her shoulder, tinkling trams, Tet holiday. These are all the beauties of the capital back in former times.\n\nThe artists used PU and Golden acrylics to draw the murals with a durability of 5 to 10 years, pasted it to the vaults in order not to affect the construction’s structure. Before drawing, the materials used to paint were all processed with a waterproof layer behind. Among these works, there are some murals were painted in 3 dimensions to form an effective interaction with the viewers. All of it evokes the nostalgia for both the local and tourists can easily receive Hanoi’s cultural value and history in a natural way.\n\nComing to Hanoi, don’t forget to stop by this mural street to enjoy the works of art which depict successfully the message of Vietnam’s capital. A thousand-year-old Hanoi is facing major changes. Yet, the city still upholds the spirit of tradition and culture to impress Vietnamese people and the friends around the world on their memory.\n\nWith a length of 200 meters, Phung Hung mural street, which is close to Dong Xuan market, Hang Ma street, Hang Luoc street, is considered as a site for cultural exchanges. There are many entertainment activities, traditional folk games and performances held on the street. Phung Hung mural street is also a place connecting history and memory of Hanoi to the contemporary art right in the common space for the public.\n\nAt the weekends, children can come here with their families to play traditional folk games. The elderly goes there for contemplating the murals and think of their old days. The youngsters get their friends to take selfies, save the lovely moments of their youth. In addition, tables of tea and some traditional confectionary are displayed for the tourists to take a rest and photos like banh phu the (literally “husband and wife cake”, a sweet cake made of rice or tapioca flour and gelatin, filled with mung bean paste; also spelled banh xu xe), peanut brittle (a traditional candy made from roasted peanut, sugar and malt) and so on.\n\nPhung Hung mural street partly contributes to honor, uphold, and bring into play the social value of urban heritage of Hanoi Old Quarter. At the same time, it creates a new public space for the citizens, tourists in Hanoi. Paying this mural street a visit is also a chance for the public art works come closer to the people.",

From whimsical designs to thought-provoking illustrations, the street murals of Hanoi are a testament to the thriving urban art scene.\n\nEvery corner turned revealed a new masterpiece, each one more captivating than the last. From larger-than-life portraits to intricate geometric patterns, the diversity of styles and themes showcased the boundless talent of the artists who call [Location] home.\n\nOne of the highlights of my street art adventure was stumbling upon a series of murals that told a story of the city's rich history and cultural heritage. Through a combination of vivid imagery and symbolic motifs, the artists had created a visual narrative that resonated deeply with both locals and visitors alike.\n\nBut it wasn't just the content of the murals that left a lasting impression; it was also the sheer scale and craftsmanship of the artwork. From meticulously detailed portraits to sprawling panoramas that spanned entire buildings, each mural was a testament to the skill and dedication of its creator.\n\nMoreover, the accessibility of the street art scene in [Location] was truly remarkable. Unlike traditional art galleries, which can sometimes feel exclusive or intimidating, the open-air nature of street murals invites people of all ages and backgrounds to appreciate and engage with art in a more casual and inclusive setting.\n\nAs I meandered through the streets, camera in hand, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and inspiration at the beauty that surrounded me. The street murals of [Location] are more than just paintings on walls; they're a reflection of the city's soul – its creativity, diversity, and boundless imagination.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned art enthusiast or simply looking to experience something new, the street murals of Hanoi are a must-see attraction that promises to inspire, uplift, and ignite the imagination.",

To be honest, I don't smell the egg odor at all, so enjoying it was easy. Their bestseller is the egg coffee, but they also have some other great coffees on the menu.\n\nI love their small table setup, which allows you to spend time with friends and have a decent chat.\n\nThe price is reasonable. A cup of egg coffee costs only 35k VND.",

It is worthy a try! If it is your first egg coffee my suggestion is to try the hot one, which is creamier and more coffee like. Give in and get a sweet break!",

All of their drinks with the  creamy egg is really delicious. Thick. Yum.\n\nBut, i would wish for a cleaner place, less hot, and more comfortable sitting area. For bigger and taller people, it was really hard to stay there. The kitchen was also very dirty. You can see it as you go up. I did not dare check out the toilet though. Most toilets/comfort rooms in Hanoi are not very hygienic. :(\n\nBut overall, I would still recommend and even come back. 🙏",

                                   "It is said to be the birth of egg coffee, with a recipe founded way back in 1940s. Located in old quarters, it is easily accessible yet also easy to miss while walking along the main road due to its narrow entrance.\n\nAfter walking through a short alleyway, you will be greeted by the staff who speak very good English. There are 2 levels in this cafe, do sit at level 2 balcony area for some street view. Menu includes coffee, tea, as well as juices, but if you’re here, do order the famous egg coffee. As strange as it may sound, it has a long history where egg yolk was used to replace the scarce milk, and has now become a well know Hanoian delicacy.\n\nHot egg coffee will be served with a small thermal bath to keep it warm. Start off by scooping up a little of the foam to taste it, it’s foamy and rich and has a slight hint of egg in that. Then, you may try some of the coffee beneath it. After that how you consume it is totally up to you (do note that the coffee can be quite hot so be careful). I definitely enjoyed the hot egg coffee more, especially in the cooler winter weather.\n\nOverall, a definite must to visit this place - for the coffee, for the history, for the ambiance.",

Hot is better than cold in my opinion. Not sure if there is a correct way to drink it but I sipped it to let coffee flow through the egg. After drinking half, I just mixed the rest of the egg and coffee. Also tried the egg rum based on other reviews and did not disappoint.

Kids got some other iced coffee drinks, which ended up being a lot of crushed ice with some flavoring. The prices were cheap enough. The cafe is situated up stairs and there are varying rooms, all crammed with small stools and tables (pretty typical for Hanoi) to sit and sip your drink. The cafe was a bit dirty, but it didn't detour us from enjoying our visit and drinks for what they were. The waiter picking his nose in the chair next to our table was probably the biggest turn off, to be honest.\nIf you are looking for a bit more of a city vibe, I suggest you head down to La Capo Cafe by St. Joseph's Cathedral. There's some outdoor seating as well as cool indoor tables. And the milk coffee and egg coffee are on point.",

I know that there is plenty of other great coffee all over but why not go to the spot where the egg coffee started.\n\nEgg beer was good. But I split one with my wife and we couldn’t finish it. Very foamy. But delicious",

Watched some VLOGs which introduced this cafe and we visited.\n\nLocated in the old quarters of Hanoi and one has to walk into a small alley before seeing the cafe. There were a lot of seatings at level two. They used the low chairs which was typical in Vietnam which gave the place a very local and nostalgic feel and vibe. Walls were decorated with pictures from old which added to the charm of the entire cafe. Here, one needs to try their egg coffee. I was lost as to whether to choose the hot or the iced one, and it’s easy to solve, just ordered both. Personally I’ll prefer the hot one as the taste was more acceptable and mild. Whereas for the iced one, I could taste a slight gamy taste from the raw eggs used.\n\nOverall a wonderful local experience. Highly recommended!",

They had free wifi and ac on the 2nd floor with little balcony plus view of busy road.\nThe waiter who served us was also very polite. He didn't speak english (we used body gestures and pointing out at the menu book) but he really tried to understand that it was better to avoid unwanted things, he used google voice translate. We could feel the hard effort in his service. Thank you so much! 🙏",

One is in the bar and one is more outside with a nice view of the cathedral. The bartenders and owner were talkative and we had a good time just hanging at the bar trying different cocktails.

Nice view overlooking the church, but no air conditioning and quite humid.\n\nTried their pandas and coconut gin, interesting spin, but would prefer they have more fruits based gins though.

Down stairs is a bit more like a little speak easy bar with a different but equally nice vibe.

It has some great views.\nThe drinks menu is quite extensive. There are gins listed by flavor/origin. Apart from that they also have classic cocktails and beers.\n\nThe bartenders know their gin and can suggest some good drinks. The tasting flights are great and you get to sample different gins with variius different infutions/herbs/spices.",

It's nice to gaze at them while sipping your gin.\n2. The drinks are not expensive and they are very good.\n3.  The furnitures here and the interior design of the place is very creative.

The guy who meets you at the door seemed like he didn’t want us there but there was another guy who when we politely asked for a drink he just looked up at me and then continues sitting in his chair looking at his phone. There was no one behind the bar. Who else am I supposed to ask for a drink? I sat down for a few minutes and then I went asked again and was given the same reaction so we left.\nHanoi is full of bars offering something unique with great service. I’ll take our custom elsewhere",

                                   "It locates some 14 km from city centre of Hanoi. In a hot summer day & in adventure mood, we took local city bus number 47A departing from LONG BIÊN station. Its last stop is BÁT TRÀNG ceramic village's market. City Bus is a very basic means of transport. It costs only 7000 VND/ one way ( $ AUD 0,5), taking 30 mins. Don't take 47A bus line if you can afford to rent a private car ( especially you may buy something heavy & don't want to carry all along).\n\nThis village's market operates in traditional way meaning lots of bargain, no air conditioning, narrow pathway, selling mix of genuine village products as well as imported ones. Try to avoid its public toilet if you can. Otherwise, I enjoyed good fun of watching local artists working in workshop. Outside market, there're many townhouse shops selling up market items. There are tourist electrical cars serving visitors if you can not walk long.\n\nTIPs: For whom like something cool drinks or clean restroom, just 800m away from market, you look for ECOPARK \" residential village\". There you enjoy drinks comfortably in air conditioned space in Highlands Coffee or, Starbucks Coffee.  Near exit ( entrance) to Ecopark, you will notify a Bus Stop Sign so no need to return the village market. Just wait here to catch the same 47A city bus. There's a ticket conductor working on bus, you pay cash & he gives ticket.",

Surrounded by many coffee shops and massage centers. Easy access to bike rentals and the staff was always ready to help at any hour of the day, night shift boys were super friendly and accommodating. Linda, the manager responded to us very well and helped us in booking tours and cabs. Rooms are good and spacious. I would surely recommend this hotel.",

The staff is so friendly and dedicated that you would think they were all the owners of the hotel.\nEven before we arrived in Hannoi, the travel manager (Linda) sent us an email with tips and warnings for our trip through Vietnam. She then helped us perfectly to plan our next trip. Even when we had already traveled further, she was a trustworthy contact for us during our further trip and organized many things for us.\nThe hotel is super clean and every wish is fulfilled immediately. All the employees gave us good tips about what was worth seeing and what wasn't really worth it.\nThere is no large breakfast buffet like in other hotels, because you order à la carte and the food is freshly and individually prepared for each guest.\nWhen we had to leave very early, the staff started extra early to prepare breakfast for us. We felt very comfortable in this family atmosphere and are therefore happy to recommend this hotel.",

Only in the roof there some window but little light came through.\n\nExperience now learns that this is more common in Vietnam. So check the description and look at the photos of you don’t want this. Of course if you only want a place for one night to sleep this might be fine for you.",

It is a lovely hotel situated in the heart of the city, the rooms are clean and modern and the hotel also offers free breakfast everyday, with western options and the rooms are also cleaned daily. However, what sets this hotel apart is the team that work here with a massive special mentioned to Chloe and Linda. The hotel staff will be able to assist you with either any enquiries or problems you have. On my trip I had a little disaster and I had to unexpectedly return to Hanoi and I checked straight back into the hotel to be greeted with a big smile from the whole team and they were amazing with helping me sort everything I needed to. They went above and beyond, more than I could ever imagine and I couldn’t be more grateful for the team here as I’m not sure what I would of done without them. Once again I could recommend this hotel enough, if you are looking for a nice, lovely hotel with the most welcoming and attentive staff then stay here.\n\nThank you so much team! Love Beth and Meg",

Mrs. Linda gave me all the information and booked me a professional city tour guide. When I found some ants in my room, she upgraded me to a better room. Doung is a great chef, he made food as per my requests. He also serves in room and helps as a bellboy. Chloe is always dressed traditionally, which is a delight to watch. She served me in restaurant and helped me at reception. Trang in the evening shift helped me to book food from outside. She also made it warm and served in the restaurant. Nhi is the youngest, she dresses modern, and serves in the restaurant. They don't expect any extra money, but rather give you discounts on their services. They also booked me an Airport taxi. After staying in 100's of hotels around the world, I feel they are better than most 5 star hotels in terms of their hospitality.",

I was already scammed by the time I reached hotel from airport but the staff went above and beyond and helped me get my money back. They put a lot of time and effort to do it even though it was my stupidity to not to listen to their welcome email and take a fake grab from airport. Each member of the staff Linda , Saffron, Chloe, Lilly, Macus, Leon and the cleaning ladies , tries so hard to make your stay worthwhile. I think if you follow the standard , it is easy to provide a nice hotel stay but to make a hotel feel like home , it is very hard. I have to say this guys have succeeded in that . I initially booked only for 3 nights but since it was an amazing service I extended 3 more nights. Linda helped me with tours and gave me good suggestions. I personally think it is better to book from hotel since she makes sure you get what you want and deals with any unexpected changes. I saw that she was working so hard to reschedule tours for some customers because of unexpected typhoon. The breakfast is also amazing. They do cleaning everyday, I got a deluxe room , was quite big for a single person but I like the space. The ceiling is quite high, feels like you are in a palace. There is also a small it functional gym in top floor where I did yoga everyday. The staff also helps with you any silly doubts , gives good suggestions for street food and always happy to talk to you when you are bored . There has been late nights when I was offered free snacks and tea while just chatting in the lobby.",

                                   "UNSANITARY. BED BUGS & MOLD\nI have no idea how this place has so many good reviews, My experience was absolutely terrible.\nUpon entering the room it seemed very run down; but we aren’t picky and don’t mind staying in an older hotel. We dropped our bags and left to explore.\nWe came back late, and to our surprise the staff was downstairs sleeping on the couch-this spooked us because it was pitch black and we weren’t expecting someone to be sleeping in the lobby.\n\nWhen we got to the room I turned on the shower and accidentally (but thankfully) hit the button to the bathtub jets-The jets turned on and started shooting black fluffy mold out into the bathtub. These jets had obviously never been cleaned before. I went to go tell my husband and was informed that the night has gotten worse- he found a bed bug. He was looking at the sheets , because they were stained , and he noticed the bug by the head board.\n\nWe tore the bed apart  looking in the sheets and in/under the mattress with flashlights (because the one lamp next to the bed didn’t work-surprise) only to find multiple bed bugs in the mattress.\nAlong with little bugs we also found piles of hair under the mattress cover (that was not mine as we hadn’t even laid in the bed yet) and hair and dust in the head board making it clear they don’t clean these rooms.\n\nWe told the staff (who was downstairs sleeping in the lobby) and they told us they had no more rooms but changed our sheets (with similar yellow stained sheets). The staff at the hotel was very sweet and as helpful as they could be , but we didn’t feel comfortable staying in the room for the rest of our stay, so we booked another hotel and left that next morning.\n\nWhen we contacted the manager , Linda, she refused to give us a refund. We paid for 4 nights and had to leave because the room was so unsanitary and they didn’t have another room for us. We showed her pictures and videos and she still refused to give us a refund; but instead she tried to flip the situation and blame us because we had left and didn’t fulfill our 4 nights. She thought that changing the sheets was enough, but the room needs a total deep clean and the mattress needs to be discarded.\n\nI understand stuff happens when you’re traveling abroad and you’re bound to run into a situation like this at some point. I just think the way Linda handled it was unprofessional and it was very upsetting that we have to pay for a hotel that we didn’t stay in for a reason the hotel was responsible for. We had been traveling around Asia for a month and stayed in many different hotels, and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had.",

Location was super convenient, in the center of the old quarter, close to the night market and many restaurants. What made the stay exceptional was the staff.\nSaffron was friendly, attentive and super helpful. Made us feel very welcomed and so did the rest of the staff. They also arranged airport drop-off for us which was super convenient. (recommend doing that rather than getting a taxi). Would definitely recommend staying here if you're in Hanoi.",

Yes most Vietnamese people will greet you with unmatchable hospitality, but each and every staff member here goes the next level. Expect big smiles, attentive conversations, recommendations & even a cuddle. They’ve helped me hugely during my time in Hanoi and this place will always be my ground base before exploring more of what Hanoi has to offer on my next visits.",

                                   "Location, Location, Location. This is the mantra of real estate and Luxury old quarter has taken this advice well. It’s situated very close to Hoan Kiem lake, where you can go out for your morning walks or evening strolls. It’s also close by to the Hang Dao street where Night Market gets setup on FRI-SUN from 06:00 PM - 12:00 AM. This is the best place to do shopping in Hanoi. Put on your haggling hats and catch those lucrative deals. In addition, there are a lot of good restaurants in nearby roads including Bun Cha Dac Kim a Michelin rated eatery.\n\nWe got a family suite which had excellent city views. The rooms were clean and hygienic. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is served on the first floor and is freshly prepared on request.\n\nWe took help of Lynda (the manager) to book trips to Ha Long Bay, Pottery village and Sapa for us. She did an excellent job understanding our requirements and our trip schedule so that she can connect us to the right points in the trip and ensured we reached back to Hanoi airport from Sapa safely.\n\nThanks a lot to the Luxury old quarter team for making our trip so memorable.",

                                   "During our recent visit to Hanoi, we stayed at the Luxury Old Quarter Hotel, opting for both a standard and a triple room. Initially, we were disheartened by the smaller size and lack of views from these rooms. Our feedback on the standard room led to a denied refund request for the second night, but Linda, the hotel's manager, offered an upgrade to another room on the second night, at an additional fee. This upgrade was a significant improvement, moving us to a room on the sixth floor that not only featured a Jacuzzi but also boasted a very nice sit-out area in the balcony, enhancing our experience substantially.\n\nIt’s important for guests to note that many rooms, may lack external views or balconies. The hotel also operates without an on-site restaurant, offering a breakfast service where guests pre-select their menu items the night before for preparation in the morning.\n\nThroughout our stay, we noticed other hotels situated closer to old quarters main attractions, offering larger rooms, on-site dining. These features are compelling for those looking to immerse themselves directly in the city's vibrant life.\n\nThe staff otherwise was very attentive, polite and humble all thought out our stay!\n\nPros - Location. Executive suite\nCons - no restaurant, standard rooms",

The level of detail and creativity in these mosaics is commendable, making it a worthwhile stop for art enthusiasts and tourists alike.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the road is unfortunately situated right next to a noisy and polluted street in Hanoi, which somewhat detracts from the overall enjoyment. The constant traffic and dust from the road can make it challenging to fully appreciate the beauty of the mosaics.\n\nIt's disappointing that such a fantastic display of artistry is located in such close proximity to an unpleasant environment. The Ceramic Mosaic Mural Road deserves a more serene and tranquil setting to truly allow visitors to immerse themselves in the artwork. Nonetheless, if you can look past the distractions of the street, the mosaics themselves are undeniably impressive.",

                         "Long Bien Bridge, constructed between 1899 and 1902 under the supervision of Governor General Doumer, is a remarkable French colonial architectural marvel in Hanoi. Despite its French origins, the bridge stands as a testament to Vietnamese craftsmanship, as it was completed with the labor of over 3000 Vietnamese workers using local materials. Originally named after Paul Doumer, it spans over 2 kilometers across the Red River and was once considered the most impressive bridge in Indochina during the nineteenth century.",

I also felt rather unsafe on my crossing. You walk on these thin, single stone tiles on the floor, some of them move and jiggle a bit when walking on them. Also there‘s a constant stream of scooters rushing by you very close and honking constantly. I would not recommend it and save the time to do something else..",

                                   "The bridge is has a very rustic look and there is a rooftop cafe where u can overlook the bridge or u may enjoy the train station cafe located just by the end of the bridge\nThe Long Bien Train Station is one of the two main railway stations of Hanoi. It is not the most impressive station, but the location right in the residential area makes it quite unique. Unlike the famous Hanoi Train Street, where the train runs right next to the houses, this station is built partly on a higher elevation. Although, the train track from the station to the bridge, you can find a very similar scene with less tourist. If you are in the area, a quick visit is worth it.\n\nThe Long Bien station is just 900 meters from the heart of Hanoi Old Quarter, just on the edge. The beginning of the Long Bien Bridge is a bit further, around 1,5 km. You can walk to here or take a taxi (motorbike or car).\n\nAs mentioned, the Old Quarter is very close to here, so you can perfectly combine these places. Just a few hundred meters from the Long Bien Railway Station is the Dong Xuan market, the biggest market in Hanoi. It is great to visit this market and if you have just seen the sunrise at the bridge, this might be a good place to find some breakfast. There are not many other places you can visit in walking distance.",

                                   "Long Biên Bridge (Vietnamese: Cầu Long Biên) is a historic cantilever bridge across the Red River that connects two districts, Hoàn Kiếm and Long Biên of the city of Hanoi, Vietnam. It was originally called Paul Doumer Bridge.\nHistory\nThe bridge was built in 1899–1902 by the architects Daydé & Pillé of Paris, and opened in 1903. Before North Vietnam's independence in 1954, it was called Paul-Doumer Bridge, named after Paul Doumer – the governor-general of French Indochina and then French president. At 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) in length, it was, at that time, one of the longest bridges in Asia. For the French colonial government, the construction was of strategic importance in securing control of northern Vietnam. From 1899 to 1902, more than 3,000 Vietnamese took part in the construction.\nIt was heavily bombed during Vietnam War due to its critical position (the only bridge at that time across the Red River connecting Hanoi to the main port of Haiphong). The first attack took place in 1967, and the center span of the bridge was felled by an attack by 20 United States Air Force (USAF) F-105 fighter-bombers on 11 August. CIA reports noted that the severing of the bridge did not appear to have caused as much disruption as had been expected.",

Constructed around 120 years ago, it is the oldest church hosting religious activities for Hanois parishioners. Its design bears resemblance to the architecture of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral.

                                   "Visit St. Joseph's Cathedral of Hanoi\n\nAt the heart of Hanoi stands a weathered neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church, a contrary sight in this predominantly Buddhist city. St. Joseph Cathedral is a 19th-century neo-Gothic church built with the Notre Dame of Paris in mind. The church is a gathering place for Hanoi's large Roman Catholic community and is also popular with tourists. Constructed when the French first occupied the city, St. Joseph Cathedral is a striking example of colonial architecture in Hanoi.\n\nTo build the church, the French demolished the ancient Bao Thien pagoda that had stood there for more than 800 years. The contrast between the two religious buildings was dramatic. St. Joseph Cathedral’s neo-Gothic cross, towers and nave are distinctly European. At 64.5 metres (211 feet ) long and with bell towers reaching 31.5 metres (103 feet) high, it’s an imposing structure.\n\nWalking west from Lake Hoan Kiem to reach St. Joseph’s, you’ll see the church’s faded exterior in the distance. The area around the cathedral is popular, and its streets are lined with trees, hotels and boutique stores. Many visitors find this area a pleasant break from the more hectic Old Quarter.\n\nYou enter the church through the side door, not the main entrance. Inside, the original stained glass windows and religious murals maintain the traditional European style of St. Joseph’s exterior. Conventional Vietnamese decorations adorn the aisles, walls and altar. St. Joseph Cathedral is located just west of Lake Hoan Kiem, close to several bus routes and walkable from the Old Quarter. Entry to the church is free. Opening hours fluctuate, and you’ll likely find the church closed at lunchtime. Services are held throughout the week, and the church is often full.",

                                   "Nestled amidst the bustling chaos of Hanoi's Old Quarter, St. Joseph's Cathedral stopped me in my tracks. One minute I was dodging motorbikes and haggling for souvenirs, the next I was standing before this majestic structure that felt plucked straight out of Europe. The twin bell towers and rose-colored facade were a sight for sore eyes, a tranquil escape from the frenetic energy of the city.\n\nStepping inside, I was met with an unexpected hush. The cool air and muted light offered a welcome respite from the Hanoi heat. The cathedral's interior wasn't grand or ostentatious, but it held a simple elegance. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns onto the polished stone floor.  There was a sense of peace that resonated within the walls, a stark contrast to the whirlwind outside.\n\nI spent a good while wandering around, taking in the details – the ornately carved wooden pews, the towering crucifix, the flickering candles. Even though I'm not particularly religious, there was a undeniable spiritual energy to the place.  It felt like a space that had witnessed countless prayers, a sanctuary for locals and visitors alike.\n\nOverall, St. Joseph's Cathedral was a surprising gem in the heart of Hanoi. It's a place that offers a moment of serenity amidst the urban jungle, a testament to the city's rich blend of cultures and influences. Whether you're seeking a spiritual refuge or simply a beautiful architectural sight, St. Joseph's Cathedral is definitely worth a visit.",

                                   "Thanks for yet another fabulous golf holiday in Thailand. This was our 6th and probably our best yet. This time we were a group of 18 visiting Hua Hin and Phuket. We all loved Banyan and Black Mountain (HH) and Red Mountain & Blue Canyon in Phuket. All the hotels we stayed at - Sofitel (Bkk) Centara (HH) & Angsana (Phuket) were fabulous. The transportation to and from the courses and additional transportation to other places of interest were on time and efficient. Lit who set up our programme and Bua our on-the-ground guide were enthusiastic and a pleasure to deal with. Everything went without a hitch, according to the schedule that Lit had assiduously set up for us. Thanks to Luxury Golf Tours for their attention to detail and meticulousness. In doing so, you took the stress out of travelling in a large group where things can go horribly wrong very quickly. Because the planning was so thorough, you made everything enjoyable, stress free and fun. We're already planning for next year.",

The 2 days one night cruise arranged was also most enjoyable. Julia Pham the person in charge was always prompt and responsive to all the messages and enquiry. 4 of us were appreciative of her excellent service.",

Everything went smoothly from arrival, transfers to and from the golf courses and departure from HCM. We played 4 rounds at Twin Doves, Vietnam Golf, Long Thanh and Tan Son Nhat.  The courses were superb.  We thoroughly enjoyed the holiday and left with wonderful memories.  If you are planning a golf holiday to Vietnam you should check out Luxury Golf Tours.

The tour guides name was Larry and he was excellent.\nIf you are going to use these guys ask for Larry as he can speak fluent English not like there other guy also he is very very trustworthy.\nI am not sure what the second drivers name was but he was great as well.\n\nUnfortunately the experience we had in the first week and a bit has left a very unpleasant taste towards this company.\n\nPlease be careful before booking.",
