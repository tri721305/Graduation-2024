Painted on the walls of its grand concourse are fascinating historic maps of South Vietnam, Saigon and Cholon, while a mosaic of Ho Chi Minh takes pride of place at the end of its barrel-vaulted hall. Note the magnificent tiled floor of the interior and the copious green-painted wrought iron.\r\n",

Stunning architecture, great selection of postcards that you can choose from and easily pay to send off from there. On either side of the entrance are gift shop stores full of any souvenir you could think of. The postcards on the glass counter in the middle of the post office have beautiful hand drawn and painted ones to choose from. I recommend going for the experience and to say you’ve been!",

Postcard can be purchased at one of many souvenir shops around inside the building. The postcard ranges from 25,000 onwards. So effectively a postcard along with stamp would cost 55,000 onwards, nice postcard and it’s a good memo to send Home to send self to Home.",

This fully functioning post office is also a must-stop for tourists and has a souvenir shop. The beautiful building features elements you'd see in period documentaries, and it gets even better inside with its high ceilings and spacious interior.\n\nIf you’re looking to mail a postcard home or simply admire the architecture, this is definitely the place to do it! It also houses a few souvenir shops. Even if it’s not of particular interest to you, a quick stop is highly recommended.\n\nAround this area, there are numerous tourist activities like hopping on the city tour bus or a jeep tour. The book street beside the post office is a highlight, along with the lovely cafes nearby. If you're visiting by bike, there is a nominal parking fee.",

Very very detailed and thorough.\n\nMany storeys in the building.\n\nI must warn all tourists though. There is(are) a(a few) coconut scam artists around the entrance or the area who would try to strike up a conversation with you and then open a coconut on the spot (as if they are being nice and offering to you for free) then charging you 300,000 dong for it! This is crazy and ridiculous! We hope that no more tourists fall trap to this anymore. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼\n\nVery disappointed by the behaviour of these scam artists stationed around the area of tourist spots and soiling the image and reputation of Vietnam.",

The sheer amount of force in the form of tanks, planes, armored vehicles and missiles, bombs, bullets.. to silence people in their own homeland. It is simply horrible to walk through the museum and not fill humanity's failures at large through the destruction of war.\n\nSadly because the war happened in recent years, a lot of photographic evidence is available and you will feel it in your gut when you see those horrid photos.\n\nAfter visiting this museum, the outlook on life and death is bound to change. And I hope the visit motivates you to be more kind, more caring and more sympathetic to other humans.",

It is a nice museum filled with war remnants, including tanks, planes, guns, and helicopters from the US army. However, I felt this place was not for me due to the numerous graphic images and photographs (corpses, dead babies, tortured prisoners of war, and blown-up soldiers) covering the walls, while information about the war is quite minimal. I know pictures speak louder than words, but I believe it should have at least a PG-13 rating since children are allowed. If you're American, note that the history presented here differs significantly -  it depends on your point of view, so take it with a grain of salt.",

                              "I think the War Remnants Museum is a must see at least once when you visit Saigon. Welcoming you with possibly used weapons of war (I can't really say for certain whether they were real or not) at the front, the place is a good reminder of what the Vietnamese ancestors went through to get where they are now. It was quite difficult for me growing up to understand the history of my Southeast Asian neighbors, so this place successfully filled the gaps. They also had audio guides for 200000 vnd available in different languages so you could go around the place at your own pace. It is full of pictures, stories, and Remnants from the Vietnam War and the years prior.\n\nThe only thing that made me cross off a star is the fact that it is quite hot inside. If there was an air conditioner, I didn't feel it. Yes, it could be because there were simply too many bodies moving about, but as a place continously being touted to tourists, it would have been nice if the place was kept cooler. I was with my mother and the humidity and the heat made her feel so uncomfortable that we unfortunately had to cut the trip short. Maybe if there were some vending machines nearby to allow us to refresh ourselves, that could have enticed us to stay longer. If there were any, we didn't see them.",

So imagine my surprise as I walk through the exhibitions reading and seeing what happened during the occupation. War is never an answer.\n\nSpanning around 3 floors, the museum was very educational for anyone interested in Vietnam war, which I must say is a must visit for everyone. It is interesting to see the exhibits from the Vietnamese perspective which may be different from what was portrayed in the Western media. They even have audio guides in different languages and every exhibits is labelled in both English & Vietnamese.\n\nAnd as someone from healthcare, my favourite exhibition has to be the one on Agent Orange. It is eye opening to see how radioactives affect the children causing genetic mutations resulting in rare syndromes such as Crouzan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis etc.\n\nThe museum however is not air conditioned, but is equipped with fans. It might be a bit hot in there.\n\nAlso dont miss out on the Tiger cages located outside of the museum, on the right near the exit. I didn’t take any pictures as it was too disturbing. They have out together jails and cages used during the War in there.\n\nVery educational 10/10",

                              'I learned about the Vietnam War in American schools.  I have never heard the perspective from the side of Vietnamese people until yesterday.  It was quite difficult for me to get through some of the information.  Upon entering the museum complex, there is an open area filled with American made tanks, aircraft, and other weaponry.  A card identifies the piece of equipment and what it was used for.  There is a section with artifacts of cages, a guillotine, and other torture devices and encampments.  It\'s very disturbing.\n\nThere is an exhibition on the prison system.\n\nThe museum itself consists of three levels.  On the first level is a seating area and short video clips that give overviews of different exhibits.  I found this helpful and amazing.  This is a busy area, so folks walk back and forth.  There are some seats on the second level where you can watch with limited interruption.   The videos have subtitles in English.  Most of the exhibits are marked. However, I rented the audio guide, which included 89 segments.  I needed to take a break after visiting the "Agent Orange" and "War Crimes" rooms.  I was overcome by suffering.  This was devastating to me.  I spent 3 hours in the museum.  I believe that if a person has an opportunity to visit, they should.   At a certain point, I stopped taking pictures.  One of my pictures is of the Napalm girl.  This photo is very famous.  I learned that the girl was 9 years old and was running and screaming because her skin was burning. She was not expected to live, she had 17 surgeries.  Her parents died in the attack, but the girl is alive, she is married, and she lives in Canada.',

Very well organized and they present different aspects of a terrible time in their history very effectively.\nWe just walked in, very inexpensive tickets. Outdoor equipment to view and we went to all 3 floors of the museum, with different rooms depicting different aspects of the war.",

                              "Interesting museum with various military vehicles to see. It’s not air-conditioned so I found it a bit hot even inside.\nThe exhibits were informative and often very emotive which is to be expected given the subject.\nI think it’s very important for all visitors to just remember that this is a museum portraying the conflict from the Vietnamese governments side and some fact checking and critical thinking is necessary to balance the narrative. There is zero consideration of the opposing forces view point or mention of any of the wider issues.\nOverall I was left with a sense of horror at the Vietnam conflict which I think it’s fair to say is the most important aim of the museum. Just remember history is written by the victors.",

Rooms are numbered but they’re all on different floors and not in order. The information itself is really powerful and made me emotional- so be prepared. The war machines and the prisons were really interesting to see. Would recommend, just remember theres a lot of walking and the rooms aren’t air conditioned and it gets pretty packed. Entrance was 40000dong.",

The exhibit starts on the top floor, and you work your way down to the ground floor room by room.\nThe most moving part for us was the floor with all of the photos from the war...some of the images are truly shocking and the handy explanations of the shots allow visitors to better understand what was happening when they were taken, providing sombering context to the reality of what people went through during that time.\nBe warned that there's no AC in the building, just fans in the exhibition rooms so it gets quite hot in the afternoon.",

Not worth buying the audio guide as there are qr codes for cell phone access of the same audio content.",

We went for Sunday service and the very large cathedral was packed with hundreds of people. I was amazed with how efficient they served the eucharist to that many people. They offer services in English so check the times in advance if you need this!",

I went recently in July and it's still under construction but I also attended the English mass on Sunday which was a lovely experience! Wasn't as hot as I expected thanks to all the fans. The sound system I think needs some upgrade as even though I was quite close to the podium/centre with the priest, the speakers or whatever equipment were a bit too echo-y so was difficult to understand the speakers at times.\n\nI MUST SAY: the cathedral's choir and singers are EXCELLENT. Harmonizing and all that? wow. And the young woman who did the responsorial psalm when I went - *chefs kiss* simply angelic. I wish the whole mass was sung by her. I would recommend attending their mass JUST for the music.",

                              'In downtown Ho Chi Minh City, an important remnant of the French colonial period in Vietnam - the "Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception", most commonly known as "Notre-Dame Cathedral". It was built, between 1863 and 1880, by French Roman Catholics and was simply known as the "Church of Saigon". It is a neo-romanesque construction, with an all-red brick facade, two outstanding bell towers, six bronze bells and beautiful stained-glass windows. In 1959, a granite statue of Virgin Mary, depicted as "Our Lady of Peace", was brought from Italy and placed at "Paris Square", also known as "Notre-Dame Square", which is right in front of the ancient church. Immediately after, the "Church of Saigon" was designated as the city\'s Cathedral. It has been undergoing severe restoration works and has been closed to visitors for already a long time. Stroll along and try to imagine how beautiful it certainly is, a true landmark of the Roman Catholic presence in Southeast Asia. Enjoy!\nRead more',

I get it, Rome wasn't built in a day, but at this point, I’m wondering if Rome was built faster than the renovations on this cathedral. The scaffolding has become a permanent resident, and I’m starting to think it might outlast us all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love this place—the architecture is stunning, and it's a true Saigon landmark. But come on, folks, can we speed things up a bit? I’m pretty sure I’ve seen glaciers move faster.\n\nSo, here's hoping the next time I visit, I’ll be able to see more cathedral and less construction site. Fingers crossed!",

I asked some people seated next to me about the time of the mass and what language would be used. Learned that It would start at 9:30 am and language to be used is English.\n\nAfter the mass, I walked behind the Altar area. There are statues of saints in this area as well as in both sides of the front section. Outside are small gardens with flowering plants and a statue of Mary.\n\nOn the outside, it is a very beautiful and magnificent cathedral. At the entrance, it was in harmony with the statue of Mary, and it was a shame that I could not see the inside because it was under construction. I really want to see the inside when I get the next opportunity, so I moved to another place with regret.",

The first Communist tanks to arrive in Saigon rumbled here on 30 April 1975 and it’s as if time has stood still since then. The building is deeply associated with the fall of the city in 1975, yet it's the kitsch detailing and period motifs that steal the show.",

The building is super impressive, and inside, you can see all these rooms and all of them were perfectly maintained.\n\nThe gardens around the palace are peaceful too. You can find fighter jet and some tanks park in the garden.\n\nThey also offers an audioguide for an additional fee, which is a great way to get even more information.\n\nNearby, there's an exhibition center. If you're planning to visit both, I highly recommend getting a combo ticket which include the audioguide fee as well.\n\nIf you're into country's rich history this is one of great places to check out!",

A lot of war materials and history facts - I suggest to take the audio commentary (an extra 100K but really worth it if you want to understand the extend of how important this building is).\n\nSCAM alert! However I would have given it 5 stars if not for the attitude of the old lady on the last floor at the beverage stand. She not only made me pay for the wrong beverage but pretended to not speak English when I pointed out her mistake and left me paying for something I ended up having to leave on the counter 👎🏼",

A tank belonging to the North Vietnamese Army crashed through its main gate, ending the Vietnam War. Today, it's a must-visit for tourists in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975. You can see two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Reunification Palace was the home and workplace of the French Governor of Cochin-China. It has lush gardens, secret rooms, antique furniture, and a command bunker. It's still in use to host important occasions in Ho Chi Minh\"\n\nThis place is like stepping back in time. It is an excellent place to take in an understand what was happening in Vietnam at the time. The rooms and the informatoln boards and photos captures a dark time in the world.

Tourists can also experience crawling through widened tunnels to gain insight into the soldiers' wartime struggles. Many find it hard to fathom how Vietnamese soldiers lived and fought in such conditions. Chinese-speaking guides provide vivid explanations of the historical significance, making it an educational experience for those unfamiliar with Vietnamese history.",

You can really spend a good half day walk around and explore or follow some random groups with tour guides, though I am not sure if there are English-speaking tour guide available but you can ask. I enjoy how many trees and plants this place have preserved. Definitely a short fun and interesting trip, with lots of things to see, and try some of the local food too.

Definitely not for the claustrophobic though, it can get a bit scary! And also highly recommended to go here with a tour group.

The environment itself is fairly scary already and I can't imagine how hard it actually was during those moments the soldiers had to fight there.\n\nThe tour guide was good, giving great examples and stories. You can even go shot a gun if your into that kind of thing. But its a good time killer if you don't have any other places in the city. Just an interesting little history moment.",

You can learn about how they were made and used, as well as see them for yourself and walk/crawl through some. Facilities are of course available. Goes beyond just the tunnels and lets you learn about more than just the tunnels. Includes a gun range too if you want to shoot M16/AK47 and more, but completely voluntary. Well worth the visit.",

Thank you to Tinh who was our fantastic tour guide.\n\nFascinating to hear about all the cunning ways the Vietnamese fought in the war. You can experience the tunnels yourself (if you’re brave enough!), witness all the types of traps and you can shoot guns too which is optional.",

But there is not much around it.\nThe price, by the way, is 125,000 dong, tour guide is included but with moderate English and not much info, just leads you through the tunnels and explains every few meters what tigers or no idea.\nOn the rest of the plant speaks as good as no one English. Caution at the shooting range, you may not hold the gun itself, is mounted in front, which takes the whole fun.\nEven with Google translate you do not get on here. A bit of a shame but well finally everyone must decide for themselves whether it is worth a full day with bus rides and in tunnel sightseeing.\n\nAfter the tunnel tour, you should explore the area yourself. There are far more places to see, but people usually wave it off and think that there are only the tunnels.",

Even though it was only an hour show, it was very good and I was entertained. A lot of acrobats, humor, and art of course.

The show started at 6pm and went on for a little above an hour. The show was a Vietnamese bamboo circus and i thoroughly enjoyed it. The show started with the slow paced village life and family life to the past paced city life with building construction scenes and hip hop dancing and best boxing. The circus featured acrobatics , hanging from ropes and dancing, tossing bamboos into the air, juggling and stunts. A very captivating show all in all. The traditional live music and it's transition to guitar and drums used for the show was also stunning.",

It's the celebrations and all, but did you really have to blast loud music, especially in a park with a temple in it???\n\nAside from that, the layout is on point. You never walked more than you had to (for the most part), and everywhere you look in the path is full of festive decorations that gives it immaculate vibes.

                              "We came to this park to get our children out of the house during their school summer break.  The park landscape is beautiful with plenty of walking paths and green grasslands.  However, our children were not allowed to play in the indoor play area at 11 am because the staff were sleeping, laying on the floor, checking their smartphones, and playing games inside. We stayed until 1 pm playing outside and left while the staff were still in the indoor play area. It got really hot playing outside in the playground area where there were lots of mosquitoes and rats.  The playground areas (indoor and outdoor) must be open for children to play during the day.  The management team needs to ensure that.  I rated 3 because its restroom was clean and plenty of space for kids to do outdoor activities in the shade.\nCan the park management team ensures that the children are allowed to play outdoor and indoor?",

It wasn’t too crowded, allowing for plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the scenery. The entry fee is a bit on the higher side, as compared to the attraction. but the experience is worth it if you want a unique perspective of the city.",

The viewing area is not big but it's nice and high enough to have a great view of the surrounding areas. The ticket wasn't expensive, around 50% less than you pay at Landmark 81. It worths to check it out at least once.",

I did enjoy being high above, without all of the city noise, just seeing the city light up. It was peaceful up there.\n\nIt was 240k dong to get in , which included a free water. There are a few informational panels, a small display of traditional Vietnamese women's wear, and some photo ops.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to be for some chill observation.",

Fantastic views, can see for miles in all directions and with the sunset too it was absolutely stunning. They also have interactive maps showing the landmarks that you\'re looking at which was a nice touch. The "art exhibition" was a bit random, there were 10 or so dresses from varying time periods and regions of Vietnam. Unfortunately the bar was closed for maintenance when we went, would have loved a drink with a view. Overall fantastic experience especially for the price, would 100% go again!',

Once you are greeted, you are taken to an elevator, and they press floor 49 for you.  It takes about 35 seconds.  Very comfortable. Once you get to floor 49, the deck opens to beautiful views of the city.  There are free binoculars to view through.  I liked all the exhibits.  There is a cyclo vehicle, a map that shows the top 20 iconic observation buildings and an Ao Doa exhibit, which shows fashion from 1613 to 1990.  There is a 7-minute film on the fashion that is beautifully done.  Water is complimentary.  Every viewpoint is amazing.  The observation deck was very comfortable with good air quality.  I enjoyed sitting and just asking it all in.  Highly recommend a visit here.",

But somehow once you enter you might feel boredom to stay here for a long time.\n\nThe ticket purchasing process was smooth and at the top level you can see the view of Saigon city from a 360 degree angle. You also can zoom to some specific place with the tower scope. If you are lucky then you're gonna see a sunset view from the top of the building. As for us it is quite unfortunate not to view that due to weather season and cloud. More and more tourists start coming as the sun is beginning to set.\n\nAll in all we still enjoyed being here. There is also a booth that sells merchandise and souvenirs of the skydeck. Free wifi is also provided on the whole level. We stayed here until around 6.30pm and I think it's a fine place to visit especially for those who want to see the view from the top and the exchange from day to night.",

You will get to see Saigon up high and see the busy streets, the tall bridges and buildings, and the river sprawling with boats. Great time and place to rest and kill time while soaking it all in that you are in the beautiful city of Saigon.",

                              "Ah, the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee building, a true architectural gem nestled in the heart of Saigon. Picture this: it’s the early 20th century, and the French colonial rulers, with their flair for grandeur, erect the Hôtel de Ville de Saigon. Fast forward to the tumultuous '60s, this elegant edifice, with its intricate façade and majestic clock tower, becomes the backdrop for one of the most dramatic moments in Vietnam’s history.\n\nIn '63, right in front of this iconic building, a group of Buddhist monks staged a protest that shook the very core of the nation. Their peaceful demonstration against the government’s oppressive policies drew international attention, casting a spotlight on the plight of the Vietnamese people. This wasn’t just a protest; it was a catalyst for change, a moment that would echo through the annals of history.\n\nToday, this building stands not only as a testament to French architectural prowess but also as a silent witness to the resilience & enduring spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nIt’s a place where the past and present collide, offering a profound reminder of the city’s rich, albeit tumultuous, heritage.\n\nQuite the tale, wouldn’t you agree?",

Quite nice and well reserved given that it is still served as the office building for the current government and administration of the city. Of course this is nothing compared to Versailles and other French world class building and architecture but I’m glad that Saigon manages to keep this building in such good condition.",

Adorned with exquisite French architecture, it serves as an ideal backdrop for capturing stunning photographs. The soft, warm hues of the setting sun enhance the beauty of this location, creating picturesque photo opportunities that capture the essence of its charm.",

Best to visit during midday at the height of the afternoon sunshine for a picturesque spot (hottest and brightest time of the day in exchange for total absence of tourist groups and buses). Batches of heavy vehicle traffic flow but you'll find a short duration during traffic light change to get the perfect photo.",

                              "This is a review about both the museum and the lovely Tea Shop in its courtyard. The museum is a must see for anyone interested in the ancient cultures of Vietnam. As to the tea shop, it is the brainchild of a Saigon native French educated economist, Dan Tranh.\nAs I expressed interest in Jasmin tea, he invited me to have some with him, from jasmine flowers harvested by him from his own garden. We chatted about his time in France, his numerous trips in Vietnam 🇻🇳 to the various tea growing regions, where artisanal methods are still used. His knowledge of tea making is vast and precise. His shop is lovely, and very inviting. It is encounters like this that make traveling such a rewarding experience! Highly recommended!",

It's a great museum with a variety of artifacts and information on the city's (and overall Vietnam) culture and history.\n\n🗿 Lots of artifacts sorted per era of civilization. Stone images and ceramics, to clothing and war.\n👀 Plaques and cards have really detailed descriptions of what you're looking at.\n🥵 No air conditioning but lots of fans. Still really hot tho!\n↕️ Lots of steps that go up and down. Not the best for elderly but there are benches in almost every corner.\n🛠️ As of first week of October 2024, the facade and a portion of the museum is still empty or under construction.\n\nYou'll need around 1.5 hours to absorb the most out of all the exhibits.",

In 1954, when the French withdrew, the museum changed its name to the National Museum and use its current name after 1975.\nVietnam History Museum in Ho Chi Minh City is located at 2 Nguyen Binh Khiem Street, District 1.

                              "Contrary to some reviews, this museum has a very large collection of Buddhist and ancient Hindu artworks. It has good representation of Chinese, Hindu, Khmer, and Cham influences on Vietnamese art. In fact, it's odd that it's called the \"Hochiminh City History\" museum, since it  covers the history of all areas of ancient Vietnam, says little about Saigon, and is more an art than a history museum. It has a fantastic collection of Hindu sculptures, and a small but beautiful courtyard garden. If I'd known what was here, I would have put it first on my list of worthwhile places to visit. Highly recommended if you love SE Asian art.",

                              "the only sorrow I visited it on time of outside restavration and fixing works so no photos of outside building. It was interesting to see, how vedic culture varies from one South-Asian country to another, and gods like Laxmi, Shiva, Vishnu have little different features with preserving all main atributes (Champa exposition) , also there are many sanskrit names on the map of Vietnam, like Indrapura and so on. Not only specific Vietnam culture, but also Kambodian, Chinese, Sino-Tibetian represented there, as it has it's place on this country. Different Buddha, Bodhisattva and Idam images and statues are exposited as well, also you can enjoy tribal Vietnamese culture. Also coffee shop and souvenir shop are inside the territory of the Museum, and peaceful inner yard with ponds and bonsai trees.",

The only problem I have with this museum is the lack of English language available for foreign tourists about the artifacts and the origins.\n\nI believe that more could be done in this aspect to bring in more foreign crowd into this museum. One last thing to note is to bring portable fan as there is no air conditioning here inside.",

                              "The History Museum of Ho Chi Minh City is a must-visit for anyone interested in Vietnam's rich history. Located in District 1, the museum is housed in a beautiful French colonial-style building that dates back to 1929. While not a large museum, it packs a punch with its well-curated exhibits that cover various aspects of Vietnamese history.\n\nOne of the highlights is the collection of artifacts from the Bronze Age Dong Son civilization, which emerged around 2000 BCE. The museum also features relics from the Funan, Cham, and Khmer civilizations, as well as a fine collection of Buddha statues. Visitors can also see a perfectly preserved mummy of a local woman who died in 1869.\n\nThe museum does an excellent job of illustrating the evolution of Vietnamese culture, from ancient times to the present day. The exhibits are well-labeled and informative, with good English translations. While there are no specific exhibits on the great battles of the past, the museum provides a comprehensive overview of Vietnam's history.\n\nOverall, the History Museum of Ho Chi Minh City is a great way to learn about Vietnam's fascinating past. The beautiful colonial architecture and well-curated exhibits make it a must-see for anyone visiting the city.",

If you're on an extended visit to Saigon, the Museum of Fine Arts might be worth a 45-60 minute quick visit, but I wouldn't rank it as a must see attraction for the city.\n\nAlthough housed in a beautiful historic colonial building, it's quite run down and in need of repair. There's only a few rooms throughout the museum with AC, so it can be a bit uncomfortable on a warm day. The collection doesn't really jump out as exciting or expansive, but it's only 30k dong for entry and located quite central in the city.",

You can visit it in less than an hour if you make it quick and focus on the highlights.\n\nThe buildings are from the founding era and worth a visit alone. The museum contains three different buildings, but the most noteworthy is the first, the main building.\n\nThe building themselves are old, and they have only an aircon in certain rooms. Fans are not everywhere present, but the window shades are closed, so there is some protection from the sun.\n\nThey don't offer any map for orientation in the museum. Also, there is a lack of signage, especially for orientation in the buildings.\n\nOn a side note, security seems pretty lax. Only security cameras are present in most rooms, and the staff present seems absent. That's not the best way to protect precious art.",

The collection is also very interesting and diverse ranging from bronze, ceramic and wood to modern fine arts spanning 3 buildings.\n\nHowever, as others have pointed out, there's no AC in the building so it gets very warm inside.

                              "Exploring Vietnamese Art: A Visit to the Museum\n\nThe museum itself is worth a visit. It’s a combination of Chinese, Vietnamese, and French architecture. It was from a Chinese Vietnamese business man who also helped construct other important and influential buildings that are still in use today.\n\nIt’s common to see people taking pictures of the building because of its beauty rather than the art pieces.\n\nBecause of budget constraints, the museum houses some average art pieces that suffer from poor quality management. However, there are still some famous paintings by Vietnamese artists, such as Nguyen Gia Tri and Le Thi Luu, which are admired by the Vietnamese people.\n\nFor a young country like Vietnam, despite its rapid development, ensuring enough food for everyone is the priority before they can focus on art and its appreciation. Hopefully, in the future, the museum will add more quality pieces to its collection.\n\nA thorough trip might take around 2.5 hours.\nTicket: 30k/person",

I’ve lost weight the last few years, and the dress shirts  started feeling a bit loose, so I decided to take them back to Tuyen to have them do some alterations on the dress shirts. Tuyen took my measurements again, and showed me in his record book that I had lost a few inches, so he had my dress shirts altered perfectly to fit my new size. And now they fit great! Always trust getting my dress shirts and suits from Tuyen. I’ve never had any problems with the sizing and quality. What’s even more special, the last time I saw Tuyen was a few years ago before Covid, and now that I’m back, he still remembers my name. Talk about knowing your customers. Thanks again Tuyen! Definitely will be back when I’m ready for more custom tailored dress shirts or suits.",

They work fast and are very accommodating with your requests, even giving me recommendations about what's trendy or currently in style. He caught my eye when he mentioned that Nordstrom had this certain shirt style in store and is popular with the latest trend.\n\nRequests can be made online and shipped to you overseas. I definitely want more suits made, and with this option, it definitely makes it more convenient to do so.\n\nGreat shop. Wish I found this place sooner!",

His attention to detail is great and he strikes the right balance between offering advice based on his extensive expertise and letting you choose exactly what you want. The attention to detail on the measurements is great.\n\nI got my suits done within 3 days. That included a fitting and adjustment. Prices are very fair. Tuyen does international shipping as well in case you can’t carry the suits or leave before they are ready. He is also happy to send you new suits with your measurements which is just awesome!\n\nWill definitely be ordering more suits in the future, and stopping by again the next time I am there.",

                              "When I first arrived in HCMC at end of 2018, I found Tuyen Tailor and ordered two pairs of pants.  I wanted material that would allow for washing at home and I’m rather tall (6’8” or 203cm).  These pants are fantastic!!  I have worn them a few days a week since then for my job, and they are still in great shape!  I also went back and had two custom suits made for myself and my son (who is 6’9” or 206cm).  The suits look amazing and fit perfectly.  If you need clothes made or altered, Tuyen Tailor is the place to go!",

                              "Cannot really put into words how disappointed the suits and shirts came out. The fitting was very poor with little improvements after the one fitting. They outsource the suit and don't actually make it from scratch. The suit came out way too small and the shirts were too big.\n\nService was poor with slow to no response over msgs. They were reluctant to adjust to my requests and tailor changes.\n\nSuit was way overpriced for their quality and service. They expect one time business so they treat it as such.\n\nSuit had lots of stray lines I needed to cut off myself afterwards. The shirts had stains somehow that I needed to wash out.\n\nReviews on Google are mostly fake. Shop around first before committing.",

Not only nice place for taking photos in traditional Vietnamese dresses.",

It's one of the few places that gives you a feel for the old, pre-war Vietnam. Excellent collection of ceramics, woodcuts, and prints of medicinal plants in particular. There is a short introductory film and then you are free to wander about through the five floors of exhibits. And yes, there is an elevator, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.

After paying for the entrance fees we were asked to sit down and were served tea while we waited to go into the room to watch the video on the FITO museum. We got an English speaking guide with an accent but we could understand most of what she was saying. There are so much to see and to learn about the medicine history in Vietnam. The collection of artwork, variety of herbs and medical tools there are simply impressive. It's also a popular place for the local Vietnamese people to visit and influences to dress up to take photos. You can also participate in some of the activities e.g. foot bath if you'd like. The tour is probably not suitable for young children.",

It's rather camouflaged between some shops.\n\nThe film at the start was interesting. There was no one else when I went. They accept credit cards only to purchase the tickets. They take only cash if you want to buy their products (tea, soaps etc) but they were flexible to use my credit card for my tea, and logged the purchase as tickets.\n\nThey gave me some info to read on my own. There were no tour guides on offer mentioned by other reviewers.\n\nNothing more to add to what other reviewers have said, other than no one mentioned that there's a very small area where you can try on traditional clothes for fun and photos.\n\nThey did also let me taste a cup of tea at the end.",

Worth a visit if you're interested in the origins of traditional Vietnamese medicine. The museum staff are friendly and hospitable and there is a planned route for the museum that covers each floor meticulously. A 10minute introductory video starts off your visit and a written guide explains each exhibit in decent detail. Mostly suitable for tourists familiar with Vietnamese and / or English.",

Maybe not too interesting for those from Asian countries where such medicines are already quite common, but still worth a look if you have some time. Entrance was 180K VND which is a tad pricey compared to other attractions. Started with a 15 min video which was quite boring tbh (if you have kids with you, forget about watching this), then a short 5-10 min intro by the staff and then you're on your own.\nThey do have 2 washrooms on site. At the end you're offered a small cup of herbal tea. They also sold some small bottled chilled medicinal drinks for 35k VND per bottle but forget about those - they taste really artificial (what to expect for the price :) ).",

The architecture is intricate, with stunning woodwork, traditional carvings, and detailed decorations that reflect the hall’s historical significance. While it’s a smaller and quieter spot compared to some of the city’s other landmarks, it’s a peaceful place to explore and learn about the region's history.

You can make offerings to many of the different gods and wish yourself well in the new year. It is located in Chinatown, and it might be a nice idea to get some healing teas or herbal remedies. There is a parking lot next door where you can park your motorbike. There are plenty of restaurants in the area to grab something to eat.",

                              "The smoke and smell of incense in this Chinese temple, together with the ornate architecture, give a rich, intense atmosphere. It was built by immigrants from Guangzhou, dedicated to goddess “Mazu”, who protects Chinese seafarers. Note that it is the image of Mazu that is the main shrine ( not Buddha!) You need time to admire the many carvings, and a guide will add value, unless you can read Cantonese! A souvenir shop is inside and also sells incense sticks or the coiled incense “cones” (VND30 000) you can light and have hung up for you.",

Many people even tourists ( most of them come from chinese) come here to make ceremonial offerings, especially on traditional vacations or Tet. This is a work architecture that is influenced by Chinese Culture. We can see many dragon and phoenix sympol or pictographic curve engraved on the wall and the roof. They are really sophisticated and mysterious that you should trip here to admire",

The temple is very spacious with 3 compartments and small outdoor spaces in between, without roof and releases incense smokes up the sky. There are also amazing sculptures of traditional Chinese folks on the roof, paintings or figures, making it also a place for traditional Chinese arts display. However, the time when I visited was in Lunar New Year, massive tourists and models for photograph have disrupted the peaceful image of the temple, with a lot of incense smoke as a consequence should require stronger act.",

                              'This is the absolute most AMAZING puppet show I have ever seen. You don\'t have to understand the language to understand the story line. The theatrics and vocals are beyond compare.\nThe music and vocals are live performers on the side of the stage. They do a great job.\nThe people that handle the puppets will make you wonder "how do they do that?" Very impressed by the whole performance',

Otherwise, you won't be understanding any of it as the matter of fact the show continues in the Vietnamese language.  The show is about the Vietnamese culture and life representation using puppets. There are shows daily at 5 pm & 6.30 pm(I am not sure pm show about the 7.45 pm show) and lasts for 45 minutes each show. Front seats are better and cost more.",

A worthy experience that can easily be a \"must see\" for a 'successful' visit to Saigon (HCMC). The only negative factor was the lack of consideration on part of a guest or two who persistently raised their hands for prolonged periods of time  to click photos/take videos of the performance, hindering the view for others (example of the guests as below in the pic seated in row H on 18 Dec 22). This aspect can certainly be looked at as a policy measure.",

It lasted about 45 mins and the children (9 and 6) were mesmerized.  None of the talking we understood but this doesn't really matter, there is enough going on with the puppets and the music to keep you entertained.

I’m not sure if that’s because we purchased tickets at the box office 2 hours before the performance, or the fact that they saw we had our 3 year old with us. Tickets are numbered at time of purchase, so they are set seats. It was so enjoyable. You can’t help but wonder how the puppeteers do it!",

                              "It was just disgusting!\nI have no complaints about what was happening on stage. The performance was funny, cute, colorful, wonderful live music... But! In the middle of the performance, suddenly a loud dance beat began to be heard from above, thereby interfering with the performance, creating a terrible cacophony along with the music on stage and breaking the whole impression of the action. As it turned out later, there are some dance courses there, and they have classes scheduled!.. How is that even possible?! I can't imagine any theater, concert, movie show, in any city in the world that I would come to, and suddenly a disco, a wedding, anything starts in the next room, which destroys the performance that I came to. I'm still in shock! Why did this become possible at all? OK, let's say there is no longer a theater on top floor, and the theater is not responsible for what is happening outside the theater. But the theater is responsible to its audience for the quality of the services provided. And if there is such a problem, then the problem must be solved! Either negotiate with the dance studio and adjust the schedule of their classes together, or make a major soundproofing. Otherwise, it's just blatant disrespect for the audience. It should be a great shame for this! But it seems that no one there is ashamed of it. The problem probably didn't appear yesterday.",

It’s a pretty short wait for most things there. However it is a bit more on the pricey side but to be honest it’s what I expected. They even had live music there which was a really lovely touch. The only downside is that people from each restaurant would try to get you to eat there and they were pretty persistent which was annoying as I felt like if I looked at a restaurant then I would be harassed into buying something. I found that the ones who didn’t do this were much better.",

There is a choice of food from approximately  20 vendors from which you can buy foods from any ethnic background including local Vietnamese cuisine. Alcoholic beverages are cheap (around 20~30K beer) and food is kind of restaurant priced (around 100K for a chicken plate).

                              "Located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We stopped by to check it out. There are so many little kiosks selling mouth-watering, delicious varieties of mainly Asian food that it broke my resolve to skip dinner. There was live music. I don't know how often they have live music. The place was crowded with locals and tourists. They have Wi-Fi. Two nice ladies helped us with the passwords. There is someone cleaning up soon after a customer finishes eating, so a table is not that hard to come by. There are fans, so it is bearable. I went to wash my hands in a clean restroom that was surprisingly air-conditioned. It was very nice and cool. I saw a young man working on his hair for quite a while. I think he was just enjoying the cool temperature. The food did not disappoint. Drinks are available at a reasonable price.",

You'll pay around 125K for duck rice here, while the real deal from the old lady around the stress of HCM will only set you back 30-50K max. The food's good, but you're definitely paying the tourist's invisible tax. Do yourself a favor—ditch this place and wander around until you find an old lady selling the authentic stuff (especially good noodles). Your taste buds and wallet will thank you! The oysters are wayyy overpriced here. If you insist on eating here, get the duck rice.. so yummy and juicy, despite the price.",

From succulent pork ribs (an absolute must-try!) to refreshing fruit juices and ice creams, there's something to satisfy every craving. The portions are perfect for sampling multiple delicacies.\nBen Nghe Street Food Market is conveniently located within walking distance of major attractions like Independence Palace, Notre Dame Cathedral, Saigon Central Post Office, and Ho Chi Minh Book Street. It's also easily accessible by e-hailing services or taxis.\nWhether you're a tourist seeking an authentic local experience or a resident looking for a delightful culinary adventure, Ben Nghe Street Food Market is an absolute must-visit destination in Saigon. Highly recommended for its exceptional food, vibrant atmosphere, and impeccable cleanliness.",

They even have live performances at the main stage which made it very enjoyable. There were a lot more people than there is tables so just have to be mindful if you plan on staying. Appears to be a tourist trap, a well thought out one, but it really wasn’t as the prices were really reasonable. Was also connected to the famous Ben Thanh Market so make sure you have plenty of time to go through it all! Could easily spend 2-4+ hours here.",

                              "This place is an absolute must for a dining experience. The venue has a collection of so many eateries, ranging from traditional Vietnamese, with cuisine from specific regions like Hue and Hanoi, plus non Vietnamese, like Greek, Mexican, vegan,  Japanese, Korean, Thai and Chinese. Prices are reasonable too. On Saturday night, they even had a band playing, which added to the lively buzz. Staff also look after you here, with cleaners always on hand to collect rubbish, plus security will help you find your grab ride and safely escort you across the traffic to your ride. We couldn't get enough of the food on offer. Plus the bars here serve up a mean long island iced tea and have beer on tap. Seriously a great venue and worth making a stop in.",

It's not as crowded in the afternoon and doesn't take long until you get your dish. I absolutely adored the vegetarian restaurant where they re-created BBQ spets and ribs from tofu and seitan. Never had anything tasting so much like pork belly before! Absolute recommendation for vegans :)",

It feels like so-vietnamese food heaven (it also has international food, beers, and juice drinks)\nYes the place is clean and reachable in the town, but the food prices are a bit high compared to the ones nearby in the city or mall food court.\n\nPaying a visit to have a chill for a while is a good thing to enjoy HCM. 😍",

Five floors up, you can see an exact 1000 Buddha temple. Each floor is unique, and if possible, travellers should go and explore the location; it is worth seeing if you are interested in Buddhism or ancient cultures. No costs, entirely free.\nIt is actually located in the centre of the structures, similar to a family living flat. So there's a little bit of confusion. There is no parking facilities over there, so plan appropriately",

                              "Arrive in the front and the parking lot / lotto attendant will order you upstairs to “Lay Phat” or pay homage to the Buddha. He knows the hike up the stairs is well worth it. The top floor has 10k Sakumuni Buddha statues. The second floor has a Medicine Buddha statue. The first floor has a Avaloketishvara (bodhisattva of compassion) with a thousand arms statue. The ground floor has various statues. On each floor, along the sides of the shrines are memorials to those who have died. Lots of wisdom candles here. It must look pretty at night.  This temple has a fortune telling machine that people really take seriously. Why not? Give it a try...\nrecommended 👍🏽👍🏽",

                              "I recently visited the Ten Thousand Buddha Temple, located at 66/14 Nghĩa Thục, Phường 5, Quận 5, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, and it was an experience that left a profound impact on me. This temple is not just a place of worship but a serene sanctuary that offers a moment of peace and introspection amidst the bustling city life.\n\nAs soon as I stepped into the temple grounds, I was enveloped in an atmosphere of tranquility and spiritual calm. The temple's architecture is awe-inspiring, with intricate designs and an impressive display of artistry. The name 'Ten Thousand Buddha Temple' is truly justified as you can see thousands of Buddha statues in various sizes and poses, each telling a story of its own.\n\nThe main hall of the temple is a sight to behold, with a magnificent statue of Buddha that exudes a sense of peace and wisdom. The walls are adorned with beautiful murals and artworks that depict various aspects of Buddhist teachings. The attention to detail in every corner of the temple is remarkable and reflects the dedication and reverence towards Buddhist culture.\n\nOne of the most striking features of this temple is its peaceful ambiance. It's a place where you can sit quietly, meditate, or simply soak in the spiritual atmosphere. The temple grounds are immaculately maintained, and the lush greenery adds to the sense of tranquility.\n\nThe temple is not only a spiritual haven but also a cultural treasure. It offers insight into the rich Buddhist heritage and is a testament to the religious diversity and cultural richness of Ho Chi Minh City. The temple staff and monks are welcoming and exude warmth and kindness, making everyone feel at home.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Ten Thousand Buddha Temple was a deeply enriching experience. It's a place that offers a unique blend of spiritual serenity, cultural richness, and architectural beauty. I highly recommend a visit to this temple for anyone seeking a moment of peace or interested in exploring the spiritual and cultural aspects of Vietnam. It's a five-star experience that stays with you long after you leave.",

Even we amazed that the profile of Mama Mary statue looks cute sweet liked a pretty doll. It has places outside for personal prayers. At a corner there is souvenir shops that sells religious artefact and prayer books.",

Of course, there is no explanation.\nAfter they thought that they couldn't persuade us, so they closed one door in front of us.  But at the same time, through the other door, motorcycles endlessly enter the interior of the church.\nLast week I went inside and sat inside for a few minutes.  So I can't understand this situation any more.\nIt is incomprehensible that people who do not know whether they are security guards or parking attendants are unkindly blocking places where many tourists and foreigners go before Corona without reason.\nI visited at 3:30 as I know that there is a lunch break from 12:00 to 2:00 and there is a mass at 5:30 after that.  However, it was actually closed at 3:30 PM.\nFortunately, after hearing the stories of tourists that it will open at 4 o'clock, and we sat at the Kong Cafe for a while, then came out before 5 o'clock and tried to enter the interior of the cathedral.\nAt that time, there were more than 30 minutes until the start of the mass and there was no reason not to go in, so we felt that this was also racism, and so we left.\nAnd they tried to rudely take a picture of us while preventing us from entering, so I took a picture too.",

If you are not a local, you will also likely be refused entry even if you wish to attend the mass on a Sunday. If you give an air of being a tourist, just stepping close to the gate will likely make the guards jolt from their seats to stop you. Lol\n\nI just wish they don’t discriminate entry. Maybe it’s better to actually alot a limited space inside of the premises (even better inside the sanctuary) for tourists if they cannot altogether let them come in freely.\n\nThe strict restrictions actually give out a very exclusive feeling very unwelcoming to non-local Christians.",

When google says its open it  just mean the gates are open.. you'll just have an access to the facade, you cant even go to the sides.. so as the inside.. maybe open during mass. Not worth the hustle of going especially if you're not near the area. Located at a  busy traffic area. Near the Tan Dinh market",

However, when we arrived during the posted opening time, it was unexpectedly closed, and no one around seemed to know why. It was disappointing not to be able to go inside, but the exterior alone is still worth seeing. Hopefully, they’ll be more consistent with their opening hours in the future, as it’s a place many visitors are eager to experience fully.",

You cannot reach Jesus statue because the area is closed and guards will immediately stop you. I mean, why would you build a big beautiful statue and then forbid anyone to get close to it? This is strange and unusual, almost every church I visited is open for everyone and you can walk around, take pictures, e.t.c. But here you go 5 meters right - 5 meters left, the guards will start screaming and trying to stop you. Is this a prison or a church really?\nAnd by the way, I visited it during Saturday morning when all the churches are usually open",

                              'It was built during the French colonial period in the 1870s and completed on 16 December 1876, when Vietnam was part of French Indochina. The architecture is mainly neo-Romanesque, but it also has some neo-Gothic and neo-Renaissance elements. It has been painted pastel-pink both on the exterior and interior since 1957, earning it the nickname "the pink church" (nhà thờ màu hồng).\n\nIt is the second-largest church in Ho Chi Minh City, after Notre-Dame Basilica in District 1. They both belong to the Archdiocese of Ho Chi Minh City. Tân Định Church is not a cathedral; Notre-Dame is the cathedral (seat) of this metropolitan archdiocese.',

Stuff you can browse through while also having some hearty meals and juices you can spend an entire day here and buy everything or nothing. The options spoil you for choice.\n\nMost ladies run the shops and they are smart as a whip. They will bargain with you and yet make you feel happy about the sale. We got some very good bargains. We did meet the one odd shop keeper who was offended when we did not buy from her but overall the people were really nice & helpful.\n\nThe local guides will tell you about bargain steals at the night market. It's hogwash. You get equally good deals in the morning and more options. Spend the evenings enjoying the local vibe at a pub or eatery.",

I am guessing.\n\nUsual touting its present so be ready to be highly prospected by the resident stalls!\n\nPre Covid times will certainly be more active as only 40-60% of the stalls are open as of my visit in April 2022.\n\nHope the business gets back in its feet for everyone!!!!",

Of course, if you’re looking to buy souvenirs or something, you can always bargain for the prices you’re willing to pay. That’s the fun part of shopping there. I highly recommend everyone to check Chợ Bến Thành out.",

                              "Had a visit on Wednesday morning, so it is less crowded. Other days in HCM was just passed by since I stayed at a hotel nearby. It has four main entrances so it is easy to enter from any side.\n\nMy impression of this market is sellers are aggressively selling their products. As I didn’t intend to buy souvenirs from here, so I don’t dare to stop by. I just take a glance while passing by.\n\nHygiene of the food in this market I am not too sure since didn’t try it out. But I notice a street nearby has an unpleasant smell like garbage. Road surface has liquid like water coming out from garbage that make the street smelly. Not only that, I saw a worker thrown the one-time-use utensils to roadside in front of their restaurant after customer leave. This is somewhere nearby the market but not inside the market. Perhaps hygiene awareness can be improve further.",

Many booths have the same things.  The next booth, try 65% off.  Keep going and trying again and again, eventually you will find their bottom price and get the best possible deal.",

                              "Ben Thanh Market is a massive, lively shopping destination that has something for everyone. From local snacks like bags of chocolates to souvenirs, clothing, and accessories, you’ll find it all here—but don’t expect most products to be genuine. The goods, especially branded items, often seem like knockoffs, so be cautious with what you buy.\n\nA must-know tip: bargaining is key here! Start by offering half the price they quote, and you’ll often end up with a better deal. This tactic saved me quite a bit, and I noticed many tourists using it effectively.\n\nDuring my visit, I caught the market in the rain—what an experience! The streets glistened, and it gave a unique charm to the bustling environment. It’s crowded, colorful, and a fun place to explore, but definitely come prepared to haggle!",

You can bargain for souvenirs for a better price but I feel you can't get the best discount when doing solo. Furthermore, it seems every stall has the same connections whereby they will introduce other vendors to offer deals. I managed to get multiple fridge magnets and coffee. The place is a bit confusing at first but it is better to get lost so you can explore more. The establishment also serves food and drinks too but they missed my order after I waited for 30 minutes so I left. A bit disappointed but it is an opener for me.",

It’s definitely more of the same with the vendors trying their best to entice you to buy anything.\nThe market is also quite well organized with the walkways quite wide and very easy to navigate.\nThe fresh produce section on the one side is definitely not for the squeamish. Avoid if you are so inclined. The market is under roof but no AC only a few fans doing their best.\n\nIt’s worth a trip, not really cheap.

It’s definitely more of the same with the vendors trying their best to entice you to buy anything.\nThe market is also quite well organized with the walkways quite wide and very easy to navigate.\nThe fresh produce section on the one side is definitely not for the squeamish. Avoid if you are so inclined.\nThe market is under roof but no AC only a few fans doing their best.",

In the middle of the market, you'll find several old stalls where you can grab a quick meal. While the environment might not be the cleanest or coolest, it offers an authentic local experience. If you enjoy immersing yourself in local culture, I highly recommend it. The food is very cheap and quite tasty.",

The well land put maze of produce and items is wonderful to walk through and discover all the items for sale. Don't get caught up being sold something you don't want!\n\nMake sure to haggle then down in price. Start at 50% of what they state then work with them from there. If they aren't interested then walk away.  Lots of take offs and trinkets to search through.\n\nOr just a place to wander through and explore.

                              "While visiting Ho Chi Minh City,  I think every tourist visits the Ben Thanh Market.\nIt certainly offers an array of food,  drinks, shopping ranging from tailor made items, to shoes  bags  hats, materials, souvenirs and much more. I must admit my experience inside the market wasn't 5 star. We did purchase some Hermes scarves from a lovely and genuine couples stall. We also found some salt coffee my husband was after. We purchased some souvenirs from one stall owner who seemed quite happy to help find us the colours we were after, and gave us a reasonable price on a bunch of items. My daughter wanted to try some sandals on, and we found a stall we might try. We began looking and immediately the shop owner ( I suppose) was in ypur face and ready to make a sale. When I ask her for a price she said 2 million dong,  for fake birkenstocks. I told my hubby, as we do, when discussing purchases, and he said ok, let's think about it. Straight away, the lady dropped price to 1.8 m , as it was for my daughter. Hubby said, that's ok, we will just discuss it first, so 1.8 m dong equats to roughly $100 au . She didn't seem to like the fact we hadn't made a purchase, and continued to drop the price down to 1.6, then 1.2m dong. By this stage, we said, thank you but we think about it. She followed my husband as he walked away and got quite angry, vigorously and repeatedly tapping/shoving at his arm, saying ypu can't try my shoes on in my shop and not buy them. I was following my hubby away from the stall along with both my teens in tow,  she began getting angry at me too. I continued to walk away ignoring her.\nObviously,  no purchase was made. I certainly understand about how the vietnamese people need and want sales, but they should never treat people like that. No one will buy from you when you behave like that, certainly in Australia you can get fined or charged for aggressive behaviour and physical contact.  Not a good way to make a sale.\nThe stalls on the outside of the Ben thanh market are much more attractive to buy from, genuine lady's, care about their customer and giving you hood deal when purchasing multiple items.",

                              "\"A scammed place, a tourist trap?\"\n\nYou can define it yourself. Been here twice and I have a lot of experiences and mixed feelings about this market. This place has a lot of items that you can find especially if you are a tourist that is looking for souvenirs, coffee beans, and apparel. The seller here is quite aggressive in pushing you to buy at their shop but you must be more aggressive and smart to deny it. Just simply shut up, reject firmly or walk away. Avoid asking the price if you just want to know as they might push you to buy. Just let them offer the price first and if you don't like just walk away and don't bargain for more.\n\nIt happened to me bumping into this one shop owned by this sweet young lady that can speak Malay that offers me a cheaper price compared to other shops only on the first time asking without forcing me to buy from her shop. She gave me the best price and also provided me with good service and was not annoyed entertain our behaviour. For those who want to come I totally recommend you to find this lady shop to buy jersey, short, and shirt. Also don't forget to quote your best price so you can meet in the middle ground.\n\nFor those who don't want to bargain and tired of negotiating there are also a section where all the items are fixed price so you don't need to argue with the seller. Just buy it if you like and leave if you don't. I hope for those who want to visit to make a good decision in purchasing items because of interest not because of being force.",

                              "a nice market where you can buy all kinds of items such as mementos, candies, first-copy items, and locally made products. It can be a bit confusing to navigate the market, but the best way to find your way around is to look up for a marker that shows the directions of the market (east, west, north, south).\n\nAlthough some people say it's a night market, it actually closes around 9-9:30. If you're interested in the hop-on hop-off bus service, you can buy tickets at the main gate. The buses leave every hour.\n\nYou can also negotiate prices here, but it's best not to push too hard. The vendors are kind, and if you ask nicely, you're likely to get a good deal.",

                              "A very nice market place which was walking distance from our hotel near Walking street.\n\nYou need to do a lot of bargaining here to get the best rates out of them or you will be guilty of spending more for a lesser value product.\n\nThe market is clean and is centrally located. They sell here replicas and look alike of most brands across all products which also include watches, leather bags, lady bags and purses, t shirts, artefacts, souvenirs, fruits, dry fruits  etc\n\nThere are also a few garment shops with fixed pricing. My advice is to shops which have fixed prices so that you get the best and not taken for a ride and you end up paying the right prices as the currency there still confuses me. I had a few US dollars and would pay by US dollars for simpler understanding and all shops accept USD here in 🇻🇳\n\nOver all a good looking building that houses the market, reasonable prices but bargaining needed, fixed prices shops advised.\n\nOverall a lovely place for everything and anything !\n\nPlease visit !\n\nStay safe, be careful while riding bikes and crossing roads to have a memorable trip !\n\nKeep 🇻🇳 clean and plastic free.",

Just shop somewhere else would be better. Watch out with the prices as vendors are gonna rip you off. Most of the vendors here are rude and unethical.

Opening as early as 6am to 6pm, some stores open later and even closes around 8pm.\n\nEvery aisle is packed with so many different stores. They have aisles for clothing, fabrics, souvenirs, coffee, wet market and so much more. For fabrics you can even order suits, dresses etc and have it ready by the next day! Prices are cheap and reasonable but they do test your bargaining skills!\n\nIf you’re looking for fabrics with designs, I find they have cheaper options on Malaysian street which is just next door. Do head there to check out in the evenings",

                              "Ben Thanh Market, located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, is a bustling hub of activity and a must-visit destination for anyone looking to experience the vibrancy of Vietnamese culture. This iconic market is a treasure trove of goods, offering everything from clothing, shoes, and sandals to souvenirs, dry fruits, fresh produce, honey, and essential oils. The sheer variety of items available makes it a one-stop shop for tourists and locals alike.\n\nThe market is designed with multiple entrances, making it easy to access from different parts of the city. Once inside, you’ll find a maze of small shops tightly packed next to each other, creating a lively and dynamic atmosphere. While the main walkways can get crowded, there is generally enough space to navigate through the smaller alleys between the shops.\n\nOne of the key aspects of shopping at Ben Thanh Market is bargaining. Prices here are typically quoted at a much higher rate than the actual value, as the market is well-known for its bargaining culture. It’s not uncommon for vendors to start with prices that are almost double what you might eventually pay. Therefore, honing your bargaining skills before visiting is essential. The key to getting a good deal is to compare prices at several shops before making a purchase. This way, you can get a sense of the market rate for the items you’re interested in and use that knowledge to negotiate a better price.\n\nA few tips for shopping at Ben Thanh Market:\n- Don’t rush to buy from the first shop you visit.\n- Take your time to explore multiple shops and compare prices.\n- Be prepared to walk away if the vendor doesn’t agree to your offer – often, they will call you back with a lower price.\n\nDespite the sometimes overwhelming bargaining process, Ben Thanh Market is a fantastic place to roam around and soak in the local culture. The market is open until 9 PM every day, giving you plenty of time to explore and shop at your leisure. Whether you're looking to buy souvenirs for friends and family or simply enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, Ben Thanh Market offers a truly authentic Vietnamese shopping experience.",

The market are divided into different sections, though not clearly demarcated. There are the perishable sections which sells local fruits, vegetables, seafood and local delicacies and a section which sells prayer items and kitchen wares which serves mainly the locals.  The dry section  sells dried foods like dried fruits, preserved seafood, coffee, clothes,  imitation branded T-shirts and bags and various souvenirs which caters mainly to the tourists. Most of the stalls which cater to the tourists sell similar items. The vendors are busy attempting to promote their staffs to the tourists. There is also a section selling local foods, so if one don't mind the heat and the less hygenic conditions , it may be a good place to try out the local food. As the market is quite huge , to avoid getting lost it is advisable to remember the gate number where one entered the market.",

They charge tourist prices so be prepared to haggle. My advice is don’t buy from the first stall you see selling what you would like. Try a few to get the best price.\n\nIt is very crowded and can get quite hot inside. I wouldn’t recommend going on a hot day.\n\nIf your looking for a market with western sizes, and less pestering I would recommend the Russian Market. I found that one very good!",

                              "Alright, let's set the scene: me, an atheist, standing in this serene pagoda. Now, you might think, \"What’s an atheist doing at a place of worship?\" Well, it turns out, watching people practice their faith is oddly fascinating!\n\nThis place is a sanctuary of calm in the bustling city, with the scent of incense in the air and a gentle hum of prayers around you. The architecture? Stunning. The carvings? Intricate and beautiful. And the people? Full of devotion, lighting incense and making offerings with a kind of grace and sincerity that’s both humbling & uplifting.\n\nSo, if you're in Ho Chi Minh City, whether you're a believer or not, this pagoda is worth a visit. It's like stepping into a different world where you can observe, reflect, and just take a moment to appreciate the diversity of human expression.",

In front of every Buddha always have a small oil tank , you should buy a bottle of oil (10k vnd) to fill in , that means when we are going to close the death , it’s will maintain more our breathings.\n4.

                              "An Dong Market, conveniently located in District 5 near some of Ho Chi Minh City's main attractions, offers a vibrant shopping experience. The building is currently undergoing renovation, showcasing a new colorful facade that adds to its charm. This fairly large, multi-storey local market is renowned for its wide range of products, including textiles, clothing, souvenirs, accessories, footwear, and jewelry.\n\nShoppers can find goods at wholesale prices, ideal for bulk purchases. The ground floor is filled with numerous stalls selling traditional Vietnamese snacks, providing a taste of local cuisine. Despite its size, the market is very empty around noontime on a Sunday, offering a peaceful shopping experience. Note that purchases need to be made with cash.\n\nOverall, An Dong Market provides a good taste of Vietnamese market culture, making it a must-visit for those looking to explore local products and traditions.",

Shoes, cloth, bags, accessories, hat and cap, food and etc. Basically there are many whole sale shop. I heard that many of shop owner come here, buy a lot and sale them at their shop. So it's suppoesed to be less expenaive than the other. They have 4 floors and underground floor. It's huge actually.",

                              "I had a memorable experience during my visit to An Dong Market (Chợ An Đông), which left a lasting impression on me. One of the aspects I really appreciated about the market was its excellent air conditioning.\n\nAs I stepped into the bustling market, I was greeted by a cool and refreshing atmosphere, a stark contrast to the heat and humidity outside. The air conditioning made browsing through the various stalls and shops a comfortable experience, allowing me to take my time exploring without feeling overheated or fatigued.\n\nThe market itself is a vibrant hub of activity, offering a wide array of goods ranging from clothing and accessories to electronics, home goods, and traditional Vietnamese crafts. Navigating through the aisles, I was captivated by the colorful displays and the diverse range of products available.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was discovering unique handicrafts and souvenirs that showcased the rich cultural heritage of Vietnam. The market's diverse offerings catered to both locals and tourists, making it a popular destination for shopping and experiencing the local culture.\n\nIn addition to the shopping opportunities, An Dong Market also boasts a food court where visitors can sample a variety of delicious Vietnamese dishes and snacks. After a satisfying shopping spree, I enjoyed indulging in some local delicacies while soaking in the lively atmosphere of the market.",

The opening prices are really high and the vendors did not budge on their prices even though I said that I can fix it cheaper elsewhere. So I opted to shop online with the Lazada app, which is 3-4x less and delivered to my door in a week. Would not recommend clothing shopping here as it’s just a waste of time.",

Most of the sellers can speak Cantonese or Mandarin so it makes things much easier. Our gang of Singaporeans always go to one shop called Phung Thanh 凤成.\n\nThis was the first time I had my lunch here, the Pho was just so so but the fresh Sour Sop juice was very nice and refreshing.",

After choosing they will call a tailor right away to do all the measurement. The dress can be picked up within 2-3 days or 24h. It is even possible to get things done within 3h!

It's like if a kung fu movie set and a desert oasis had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a cultural gem in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the blend of styles: intricate Chinese woodwork meets Islamic calligraphy, with a splash of green that feels refreshingly cool amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a peaceful retreat where you can hear yourself think—if you're not too busy admiring the beautiful pond and lush courtyard.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a culture vulture, or just someone looking for a quiet place to escape the city noise, this temple is a must-visit. It’s not just a religious site; it's a testament to the diverse tapestry that makes up Saigon.\n\nSo, if you're in town, pop in and soak up some tranquility and history. You might just find yourself feeling a bit more Zen!",

I am not a history kind of a person but since it was a very natural environment so I liked the tour. I must mention that when taking a tour there is a point when you are offered tapioca with Vietnamese tea I was really hungry and the people out there are so friendly and so Vietnamese. I clicked some awesome pictures with them and they helped me with my wheelchair and me all the way through because there are a lot of steps that have to be climbed to get out of that place, so if there are some muscle men around you and can lift up your chair with you in it as you cannot get out of it at all then you can definitely do this tour otherwise maybe not.",

Learn about the construction of the tunnels, the traps, the concealment of entrances, breathing holes etc.\nYou can try and fire rifles like the Ak47, M1 Garand, M16 etc. However you will have to purchase the bullets, minimum 10 bullets in order to have a chance to fire the weapons.\n\nIts a half day tour which you will not regret.",

If anyone is unsure of why you should go......history speaks for itself. Go to the war museum in Ho Chi Minh then to this amazing place, it all comes together and your emotions for both places just warrant where they have been and reacted. To fire an AK47 like they did, but at a lot younger age ...some 14 I just can't imagine how they went by .......they fought for their country with pride. Respect.",

                              "The Ben Dinh War Tunnels, a part of the Cu Chi Tunnels network, is famous for its part in the victory of the Indochina Wars. Built during the resistance war against French colonizers in 1948, it provides an ideal safe base covering more than 100 hectares under an eucalyptus forest. From here, Vietnamese soldiers could withdraw safely towards Saigon River whenever the enemy made sweeps.\n\nFollowing the narrow pathways in the tunnels, visitors can see all sorts of war facilities, including surgery rooms, meeting rooms, small kitchens, etc. Notably, there is a system of deep tunnels used as a place to live, take shelter, store weapons, etc.\n\nOn the ground, there is an M41 tank of the US Army that was entangled by Vietnamese guerrillas in 1970. Visitors can also watch documentary films to understand more about the history of establishment and development of the whole Cu Chi Tunnels system.\n\nThere is a shooting range that offers visitors a chance to shoot real guns. A variety of guns such as AK47 or M16 are available to try under supervision.\n\nThere is also a souvenir shop where visitors can purchase souvenirs made from bullet casings, oil lamps, lighters, ballpoint pens, straps, or sandals made from old tires. There are also many handmade products from the craft villages in Cu Chi.\n\n*** A Word of Advice ***\nIf you plan on checking out a section of the tunnels where you get in at one end and exit at another point, please be advised that the activity is not for the claustrophobic. The tunnels get pretty narrow and tight in some stretches and you will have to move on your haunches or by crawling on all fours.\nAlso, please try and avoid when any large tour groups are at such exhibits - folks have been known to go in enthusiastically but eventually decide to back out, causing a fair amount of confusion and chaos.\nAlso, avoid going in with any baggage that might hinder free movement.",

Only fault tour guide at end of trip insists we all give both he and boat driver good tips because they don't get paid much and boat not full, neither of which is our fault and we paid alot to go on trip. Every other tour we did over 3 weeks at most put a jar out for us to give tips or expected nothing and were incredibly grateful when tipped.",

The forest area is very impressive with tunnels and camps displaying the life that was lived and the warfare that took place there. It is the only area where the tunnel system was used due to the ground water in other areas. The tour was very nice. To crawl through the tunnels is not for the faint-hearted and requires a good level of fitness and a small body stature. Don't attempt if you are claustrophobic. Smoking not allowed in the forest,  a wheelchair will struggle. It's family friendly, the walk is about 1.5km.",

On the positive side, walking through the 100-meter strip of tunnels provided a vivid sense of the Viet Cong's ingenuity. Additionally, the opportunity to taste traditional Viet Cong food and drinks added a unique touch to the tour.\n\nHowever, there were aspects that detracted from my enjoyment. The shooting range experience, lasting around 30-40 minutes, felt like being in a war zone, which didn't resonate with me. The idea of shooting a gun at a war tunnel felt unnecessary, and the crowded tour area made it difficult to hear the guide.\n\nOverall, while there were highlights, the drawbacks, including the shooting range and overcrowded conditions, led to a less-than-ideal experience for me. I would not readily recommend this place to others, as personal preferences may greatly influence one's enjoyment of the visit.",

                              "We had a great tour of Bin Dinh Tunnels.  We learned a lot on l9cation and had a wonderful, fun tour guide with us who made it both relevant but interesting for adults and teenagers alike.  The focus was a lot more on the ingenuity and creativity of the design and working/living conditions, with historic relevancy but less of the gruesome elents of the war which we appreciated given we had a teenager with us.  Highly recommend.  When kids get older, they can choose to learn more, but we got the right mix, and it kept it interesting.  Delighted, we did it.  Staff are wonderful, engaging, and incredibly helpful to tourists. The new entrance is l8ght years from the old route, so it also makes if more accessible to older tourists and has pathways a wheelchair can navigate so still inclusive for all without needing to go into the tunnels.  My niece and I did do the tunnel walk.  It was roasting hot, and truly, you do need good knees to navigate through.  I was in a lather of sweat at the end and was glad I did it.  Not for the claustrophobic, so if you have bad knees or don't l8ght tight spaces, don't go through as once you go in, you can't get back if others behind you!!  Right as we were entering, a German tourist flew back out after realizing how tight it was going to get.  I didn't have to go on my knees but had to shuffle in a bent position to walk through and I'm only 5ft 5 inches so make a wise decision or wait till the end of your group so you can go in to test your comfort level and come out if your not loving it!!!  I encourage you to try at least.  It really does get you into the true reality and you can see the navigation, depth and intensity of it.  Can't even imagine doing it with military gear, guns, backpacks etc.",

                              "I booked a tour through Tripadvisor for the Cu Chi tunnels (Ben Dinh War Tunnels) and Mekong Delta.  The Cu Chi tunnels consists of three levels of tunnels and was used by the Viet Cong.  There were many areas including  administration, hospitals, and living space.  Our tour guide was amazing.  He talked about the jungle area, tunnels, how people lived, weaponry,  booby traps, and more. We had a chance to go into some of the bunkers.  One of the scariest things was going through the tunnel.   Tourists are allowed to go into several sections of the tunnels. During my experience, as soon as I climbed down the stairs, I had to start crawling.  A lady had her flashlight on, but when it went out.  It was pitch black.  I  literally could not see my hand in front of my face.  I crawled until I saw the first opening.  There were some young people with shorts on. They were able to squat and bend their backs forward and walk, but they also came out through the first opening.  There was also an opportunity to fire a weapon.  There were seven or eight different weapons.  I chose the AK47 and purchased 10 rounds.  The weapon I shot was pretty old.  It jammed a few times.  I don't know how well I did. They don't give you your target.  But overall, I was satisfied that I got a chance to shoot the weapon.  We spent over 3 hours here.  There is a lot of history.   I highly recommend a visit.",

                              "Its very interesting to know how the Vietnamese soldiers used to hide from the americans in a 100 year long war. How they created traps to safeguard themselves and hide. You can also fire the AK47 in the shooting range, which is a must try. They have increased the sizes and added lights in the Cu Chi tunnels for us to experience, but the original sizes were very very small, only enough to fit the Vietnamese soldiers!\nI would say must visit to experience the intelligence that hey had back then, even without technology!",

Behind the statue are images of violence unleashed by the Government forces and the monk afire beside an Austin Westminster sedan, in which he travelled to the protest site. The only two journalists who were at the place when he set fire to himself accompanied by a group of monks, said that he did not move a muscle or scream out as the fires consumed him.The monk's death had major repercussions, although the repression of Buddhists didn't end that soon.\n\nThe arresting image of the burning monk was a reminder of the ongoing persecution back, using reasons ranging from NRC and citizenship bill to beef.\n\n(I first saw the iconic image of the burning monk from a 'Rage against the machine' video several years back)",

To fully appreciate this monument, a little research is necessary, and its a dramatic time in Vietnam\'s modern history, and well worth your time to visit and learn about its story.',

                              "Visiting the soul-touching Venerable Thich Quan Duc monument (aka Burning Buddha Monument) is in my top 3 things to do in Ho Chi Minh City. In 1963, the Buddhist monk set himself on fire at the busy intersection in Saigon (exactly where the monument is now situated) to protest the persecution and oppression of devote Buddhists. Despite 70% of the country's population at the time being Buddhist, Buddhists were savagely oppressed in many ways. Property was seized, villages were ransacked, people starved, and some were shot in the streets under the rule of politician Diem (who was Catholic).\n\nAfter other forms of protest had failed, Thich Quang Duc decided to make the ultimate sacrifice. He wanted the world to know of the horrors faced by Vietnamese Buddhists and bring them to an end. On that morning 3 monks pulled up in a blue car. Quang Duc sat in a lotus position on the floor counting his beads while another monk doused him in gasoline. Quang Duc then lit a single match and engulfed himself in flames and burnt for a few minutes as his body became blackened and shrivelled, and human-flesh filled the surroundings. He never moved a muscle as his body fell back. Monks ran forward to cover his body in yellow robes. They say his heart was so pure that it was the only part of him that never burnt, and is now kept in a museum.\n\nThis moment is so humbling and poignant, I really recomend visiting. Behind the statue is a relief sculpture which depicts the context for the event. To the left we see the oppression and brutality of Buddhists, in the middle we see Thich Quang Duc enveloped by flames and to the right we see the positive effects of his sacrifice; poeple are freed and liberated from the oppression.",

A pro is a variety of shops offering the same thing so you can see where a product is cheaper and buy from there. Not a must visit in HCMC but good for wholesale/ bulk shopping.",

They don’t sell individual clothes or shorts, making it clear that only wholesale purchases are available. However, we managed to buy luggage, coffee, and some adorable animation backpacks for my daughter.\n\nInteraction with the store was mixed. Some didn’t respond at all to our inquiries, while others politely declined. It was like playing a game of “Guess Who?” with the staff. Nonetheless, we found the coffee to be of superior quality and better prices than Ben Thanh Market. We appreciated the lack of pressure from the seller—finally, a place where we can enjoy our coffee without the hard sell!\n\nOne store owner informed us that brand of coffee beans, which I showed her in photos, was of poor quality despite its higher price.\n\nGuess even bad coffee can come with a high price tag!\n\nOverall, it’s a great market if you’re interested in buying food items like nuts, coffee, dried fruits, and dried seafood in bulk.",

Usually they just sell in wholesale , won’t entertain retail customers , but few of them will give you in retail . Unlike other markets probably there is no bargaining and the prices are fixed.

The nuts here are cheaper and price are mainly fixed. We got a few kilos of cashews and macadamia here. The dried shrimp looks fresh and good colour, so we got some as well.\n\nIn terms of food which is at the back lane, it doesn’t look so appetizing for us so we venture out and stumbled upon a great squid noodle place nearby\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/1QUNdpbFiuhJbWcd6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy",

                              "Binh Tay Market (Chợ Bình Tây) is a wholesale gem located slightly away from the town center, offering a refreshing break from typical tourist spots. The prices here are significantly lower, making it an excellent destination for purchasing items or gifts. The market's authentic atmosphere and extensive variety of goods ensure a unique shopping experience. Despite its distance, it's well worth the trip for those seeking great deals and a more local flavor of Ho Chi Minh City. Binh Tay Market is a must-visit for savvy shoppers and cultural explorers alike.",

                              'This local market is located in district 5, the area that is popularly known as the Chinatown in HCMC. Throughout our 10 visits to HCMC, we came here by twice and in our recent trip, we decided to revisit it to see if any changes (and also bringing our friends here).\n\nUnfortunately, the market was closed due to the Independence Day holidays and so we took photo outside of the building though staff were seen inside the building doing "worshipping" (there\'s a temple inside the market). I think the market has undergone some repainting work and now looks nicer.\n\nSince the market was closed, I could not comment on the inferior but should be "more or less" the same because from the other markets we have gone to, they too, remained almost unchanged.\n\nThen we proceeded to explore the area which was interesting. A short walk here would bring us to the popular toys street where many toy shops are located (and most were opened during our visit) and further down, the stationery and bookstore street.\n\nIt\'s a good revisiting trip! And of course, you can bet that we bought many toys, lanterns (since the mid-autumn festival is coming) and stationeries from here!',

                              "(Translated by Google) HOLY SPIRIT!\n1. Where is the address of Ngoc Hoang Pagoda?\n\nJade Emperor Pagoda, also known as Ngoc Hoang Palace (Phuoc Hai Tu)  is located at 73, Mai Thi Luu Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. This is an ancient temple familiar to Saigon people and tourists with its attractive beauty, a place to pray for children, to pray for a sacred fate.\n\nAlthough it is far from the city center, the road to the temple is relatively easy. However, when planning to visit, you also need to pay attention to the problem of Ngoc Hoang Pagoda open until what time? The temple is open every day, so you can visit and pray for blessings anytime from 7am to 6pm, especially on the 1st and the full moon from 5am to 7pm.\n\n2. History of the Jade Emperor Pagoda in Saigon\n\nThe Jade Emperor Pagoda in Saigon was built in the early twentieth century, by a Chinese named Luu Minh, himself Luu Dao Nguyen. Initially, this was the temple to worship the Jade Emperor, and was also used by Luu Minh as a meeting place for the plan to overthrow Man Thanh.\n\nLater, in 1982, the temple was taken over by Venerable Thich Vinh Khuong and officially belonged to the Vietnam Buddhist Church. In 1984, the electricity was renamed Phuoc Hai Tu.\n\nAfter a long time, Ngoc Hoang Mai Thi Luu Pagoda has now become a famous tourist destination near the Saigon River. City people and tourists have always known the temple with its sacredness, praying for children, praying for luck and praying for peace.\n\n(Original)\nCHÙA LINH THIÊNG!\n1. Địa chỉ chùa Ngọc Hoàng ở đâu?\n\nChùa Ngọc Hoàng, hay còn gọi là Điện Ngọc Hoàng (Phước Hải Tự) tọa lạc tại số 73, đường Mai Thị Lựu, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh. Đây là ngôi chùa cổ quen thuộc với người dân Sài Gòn và khách du lịch với vẻ đẹp thu hút, chốn cầu con, cầu duyên linh thiêng.\n\nDù cách biệt với trung tâm thành phố nhưng đường di chuyển đến chùa tương đối dễ dàng. Tuy nhiên, khi lên kế hoạch tham quan, bạn cũng cần quan tâm đến vấn đề chùa Ngọc Hoàng mở cửa đến mấy giờ? Chùa mở cửa mỗi ngày nên bạn có thể đến tham quan, cầu phúc bất cứ lúc nào từ 7h đến 18h, riêng mùng 1 và rằm là từ 5h đến 19h.\n\n2. Lịch sử chùa Ngọc Hoàng Sài Gòn\n\nChùa Ngọc Hoàng ở Sài Gòn được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, bởi một người Trung Quốc tên là Lưu Minh, tự Lưu Đạo Nguyên. Ban đầu, đây là ngôi điện thờ Ngọc Hoàng Thượng đế, đồng thời được Lưu Minh dùng làm nơi họp kín kế hoạch lật đổ Mãn Thanh.\n\nSau này, vào năm 1982, ngôi chùa được tiếp quản bởi hòa thượng Thích Vĩnh Khương và chính thức thuộc về Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam. Đến năm 1984 thì điện được đổi tên thành Phước Hải Tự.\n\nSau khoảng thời gian dài, chùa Ngọc Hoàng Mai Thị Lựu hiện nay đã trở thành một địa điểm du lịch nổi tiếng gần sông Sài Gòn. Người dân thành phố và khách du lịch vẫn luôn biết đến ngôi chùa với sự linh thiêng, cầu con, cầu duyên và cầu bình an.",

                              "At the recommendation of a local, I visited the temple in search of a serene environment for meditation and quiet contemplation. Drawn by its religious significance, I hoped to find a tranquil space for reflection. Instead, I encountered a bustling tourist attraction that seemed to prioritize commercial appeal over spiritual depth. Tour guides loudly explained the site to groups, while the constant hum of traffic outside disrupted any sense of calm. The temple, adorned with iconographic artwork, felt more like a venue for revenue generation than a sacred place of worship.\n\nAdmittedly, I had not researched the temple's history before my visit, so it’s possible I missed key aspects of its significance. However, the overall atmosphere left me questioning the balance between preserving cultural heritage and catering to tourism.",

I mean, exquisite woodcarvings, grand (overpowering, hovering) statues, and elaborate tile works (my favorite would be the lotus). You can't take photos inside though ❌📸 But, I guess some folks got them.\n\nThe main hall was quite grand. You can find large, hovering statues by the sides. There was one, but I'm not sure if I got the inscription right, the Chief of Hell (?) with a spear, looking down at you with huge, dark, beady eyes.\n\nAt the front, there's this heavenly depiction of Vietnamese lore and mythology. Couldn't tell if it was the Jade Emperor or Buddha, but it was gargantuan. But there were two guarding statues by its side worshipping the god. Then further flanked by its sides are little people statuettes worshipping the god. In short, it's heaven.\n\nYou can find more Vietnamese gods and goddesses in its many halls. There's one by the roof, too.",

                              "I don’t know much about the history of this temple but I wanted to take some pictures to highlight some of its gems. I wished temples have more of a history sharing component for visitors or new time comers. That would be really helpful in terms of adding value to people who would like to learn. But either way, I did noticed this temple was quite hidden and is definitely worth a visit. Very spacious courtyard and there’s a mural on the wall documenting what happens if you go to hell. I wished I could take more photos of the inside but there’s a sign that says you are not allowed to.",

                              "This Taoist Temple is free to enter and worthy of a visit if you are in HCMC. Admission is free, the Temple was built in 1909 in honour of the Taoist God The Jade Emperor or King of Heaven (Ngoc Hoang)  truly a magnificent spectacle with some quite grotesque figures on display. Please respect local traditional values and remove shoes, ensure appropriate dress, with shoulders and knees covered, photography is not allowed within the Temple.

                              "Visited on the first day of the trip on 11 Oct 2023. After checking in the hotel, I brought my parents to the Jade Emperor Temple located at District 1.\n\nJade Emperor Pagoda Vietnam is a place not to be missed when you travel to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). In addition to its spiritual element, this pagoda also possesses the beauty of ancient Chinese architecture.\n\nPainted in pink, many locals as well as tourists were there. No camera is allow when stepping into the temple,  hence no photo could be shown. These were taken outside of the temple.\n\nWe stay for about 20 minutes and left for next location.\n\nThe temple is free to visit, but a number of donation boxes are dotted around the sight. There is no strict dress code, but, to be respectful, opt for clothing that covers the shoulders and drops below the knee.\n\nRecommend taking a motorbike or taxi ride to Jade Emperor Pagoda because it is located in Binh Thanh District, which is quite far away from the city center.",

                              "This is one of the most atmospheric temples in Ho Chi Minh City, stuffed with statues of phantasmal divinities and grotesque heroes. The pungent smoke of incense (huong) fills the air, obscuring the exquisite woodcarvings. Its roof is encrusted with elaborate tile work, and the temple's statues, depicting characters from both Buddhist and Taoist lore, are made from reinforced papier mâché.\n\nInside the main building are two especially fierce and menacing Taoist figures. On the right (as you face the altar) is a 4m-high statue of the general who defeated the Green Dragon (depicted underfoot). On the left is the general who defeated the White Tiger, which is also being stepped on.\n\nWorshippers mass before the ineffable Jade Emperor, who presides – draped in luxurious robes and shrouded in a dense fug of incense smoke – over the main sanctuary. He is flanked by his guardians, the Four Big Diamonds (Tu Dai Kim Cuong), so named because they are said to be as hard as diamonds.\n\nThe room also contains the famous Hall of the Ten Hells, carved wooden panels illustrating the varied torments awaiting evil people in each of the Ten Regions of Hell. Women queue up at the seated effigy of the City God, who wears a hat inscribed with Chinese characters that announce 'At one glance, money is given'. In a mesmerising ritual, worshippers first put money into a box, then rub a piece of red paper against his hand before circling it around a candle flame.\n\nOn the other side of the wall is a fascinating little room in which the ceramic figures of 12 women, overrun with children and wearing colourful clothes, sit in two rows of six. Each of the women exemplifies a human characteristic, either good or bad (as in the case of the woman drinking alcohol from a jug). Each figure represents a year in the 12-year Chinese astrological calendar. Presiding over the room is Kim Hoa Thanh Mau, the Chief of All Women. Upstairs is a hall to Quan Am, the Goddess of Mercy, opposite a portrait of Dat Ma, the bearded Indian founder of Zen Buddhism.\n\nThe temple is free to visit, but a number of donation boxes are dotted around the sight. There is no strict dress code, but, to be respectful, opt for clothing that covers the shoulders and drops below the knee. The temple tends to get busy most days, so arrive early to avoid the worst of the crowds.",

                              "Chùa Ngọc Hoàng, also known as the Jade Emperor Pagoda, is a Taoist temple located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It was built in the early 20th century by a man named Lưu Minh, also known as Lưu Đạo Nguyên, a Quảng Đông native from China. The temple is dedicated to the Jade Emperor, the supreme deity in the Taoist pantheon .\nThe temple is one of the largest, most beautiful, and revered spiritual places in Ho Chi Minh City. It is filled with mythical statues and is over 100 years . Visiting Ngọc Hoàng Pagoda allows you to witness its stunning architecture, participate in spiritual activities, and have the opportunity to pray for peace and luck in life, especially in matters of child and love.\nThe temple is open for visitors from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM. To reach the temple, you can use various transportation options such as bus, motorbike, car, taxi, or ride-sharing services like Grab.\nWe too offered our prayer in the temple. It was a great experience as we visited the temple for the first time. It was very peaceful 😍.",

                              "A lovely book street lined with bookstores, with both Vietnamese and English titles. The atmosphere of the place reminded me of Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne – quiet, peaceful, artsy, and with plenty to explore. There are locally made souvenirs available in most of the shops as well, and is a good place to support local craft.\n\nChanced upon a street artist who was in the middle of a sketch, and he was so talented! Another great street for photography and watching life go by.",

This place is specifically dedicated to the bookworm.\nAs for normal people, it is enough just to walk, shop around and take photos on this street because it is clean, beautiful, covered with trees and also aesthetic. The street is also located at the centre just beside the Saigon post office, The Independent Palace and the park. So people can just park in one place and walk to all these places. A must visit place for a tourist",

Chairs kept in between and even in front of the shops where you can sit and read. There are many coffee shops in and around the street where you can sit and read over a cup of coffee. It was all decorated. There are couple of souvenir shops too. There is a nice display of piano in which you can walk. Enjoyed it. Most of the books we saw were in Vietnamese so couldn’t buy anything.
