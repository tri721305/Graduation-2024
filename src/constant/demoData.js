Few museums anywhere convey the brutal effects of war on its civilian victims so powerfully. Many of the atrocities documented here were well publicised, but rarely do Westerners hear the victims of US military action tell their own stories. While some displays are one-sided, many of the most disturbing photographs illustrating US atrocities are from US sources, including those of the infamous My Lai Massacre.\r\n",

There is(are) a(a few) coconut scam artists around the entrance or the area who would try to strike up a conversation with you and then open a coconut on the spot (as if they are being nice and offering to you for free) then charging you 300,000 dong for it! This is crazy and ridiculous! We hope that no more tourists fall trap to this anymore. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼\n\nVery disappointed by the behaviour of these scam artists stationed around the area of tourist spots and soiling the image and reputation of Vietnam.",

It’s not air-conditioned so I found it a bit hot even inside.\nThe exhibits were informative and often very emotive which is to be expected given the subject.\nI think it’s very important for all visitors to just remember that this is a museum portraying the conflict from the Vietnamese governments side and some fact checking and critical thinking is necessary to balance the narrative. There is zero consideration of the opposing forces view point or mention of any of the wider issues.\nOverall I was left with a sense of horror at the Vietnam conflict which I think it’s fair to say is the most important aim of the museum. Just remember history is written by the victors.",

The sheer amount of force in the form of tanks, planes, armored vehicles and missiles, bombs, bullets.. to silence people in their own homeland. It is simply horrible to walk through the museum and not fill humanity's failures at large through the destruction of war.\n\nSadly because the war happened in recent years, a lot of photographic evidence is available and you will feel it in your gut when you see those horrid photos.\n\nAfter visiting this museum, the outlook on life and death is bound to change. And I hope the visit motivates you to be more kind, more caring and more sympathetic to other humans.",

It is a nice museum filled with war remnants, including tanks, planes, guns, and helicopters from the US army. However, I felt this place was not for me due to the numerous graphic images and photographs (corpses, dead babies, tortured prisoners of war, and blown-up soldiers) covering the walls, while information about the war is quite minimal. I know pictures speak louder than words, but I believe it should have at least a PG-13 rating since children are allowed. If you're American, note that the history presented here differs significantly -  it depends on your point of view, so take it with a grain of salt.",

So imagine my surprise as I walk through the exhibitions reading and seeing what happened during the occupation. War is never an answer.\n\nSpanning around 3 floors, the museum was very educational for anyone interested in Vietnam war, which I must say is a must visit for everyone. It is interesting to see the exhibits from the Vietnamese perspective which may be different from what was portrayed in the Western media. They even have audio guides in different languages and every exhibits is labelled in both English & Vietnamese.\n\nAnd as someone from healthcare, my favourite exhibition has to be the one on Agent Orange. It is eye opening to see how radioactives affect the children causing genetic mutations resulting in rare syndromes such as Crouzan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis etc.\n\nThe museum however is not air conditioned, but is equipped with fans. It might be a bit hot in there.\n\nAlso dont miss out on the Tiger cages located outside of the museum, on the right near the exit. I didn’t take any pictures as it was too disturbing. They have out together jails and cages used during the War in there.\n\nVery educational 10/10",

And seeing things from their angels. I personally like the presenting idea of projecting the animation of the prisoners on the floor to show what they have been through in the tiger cages. I’m glad I made it here.",

It was quite difficult for me to get through some of the information.  Upon entering the museum complex, there is an open area filled with American made tanks, aircraft, and other weaponry.  A card identifies the piece of equipment and what it was used for.  There is a section with artifacts of cages, a guillotine, and other torture devices and encampments.  It\'s very disturbing.\n\nThere is an exhibition on the prison system.\n\nThe museum itself consists of three levels.  On the first level is a seating area and short video clips that give overviews of different exhibits.  I found this helpful and amazing.  This is a busy area, so folks walk back and forth.  There are some seats on the second level where you can watch with limited interruption.   The videos have subtitles in English.  Most of the exhibits are marked. However, I rented the audio guide, which included 89 segments.  I needed to take a break after visiting the "Agent Orange" and "War Crimes" rooms.  I was overcome by suffering.  This was devastating to me.  I spent 3 hours in the museum.  I believe that if a person has an opportunity to visit, they should.   At a certain point, I stopped taking pictures.  One of my pictures is of the Napalm girl.  This photo is very famous.  I learned that the girl was 9 years old and was running and screaming because her skin was burning. She was not expected to live, she had 17 surgeries.  Her parents died in the attack, but the girl is alive, she is married, and she lives in Canada.',

Instead of getting the bus (which doesn’t pass over the road), many backpackers decide to take a Hai Van Pass motorbike or jeep tour to experience the high mountain pass with the wind in their face!. The views are incredible, you’ll stop at historical sites and deserted beaches along the way and you’ll no doubt make travel buddies who you can explore Hoi An with!.

Later, it housed American prisoners of war during the Vietnam War, including well-known figures like Senator John McCain. The museum showcases the history of war crimes and offers a glimpse into the harsh conditions endured by inmates.",

The exhibits provided an overwhelming amount of information about the war and the horrific conditions prisoners endured.

It’s built on the former site of the Hoa Lo Prison (Hilton - Hanoi) and has a lot of interesting photos and exhibits from the prison during its active years.\n\nThe staff are friendly and approachable. You can also expect entry to be ~30 baht per person. I would say that no more than 1-2 hours is needed as the museum only takes up a small portion of true former prison grounds.\n\nWith it centella located to the old quarter in Hanoi it’s easy to get here by walking or getting a taxi or grab!",

The audio guide here is of good quality, and worth it. It gives a more immersive experience.\n\nYou can really feel the patriotism of the revolutionists from the prison, who still managed to educate themselves and fight for their rights within the confines of the prison, despite the inhumane treatment. My favorite part was the story of their escape, but you better go visit so you can hear it for yourself. 😉\n\nNote: Lots of walking and some stairs, but there are many seats available where you can rest. There are vending machines inside, but I recommend bringing your own water canteen.",

Known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\" during the Vietnam War, this site is steeped in history and offers a sobering glimpse into the past.\n\nThe exhibits are meticulously curated, providing a comprehensive narrative of the prison's history from its construction by the French colonists to its use during the Vietnam War. Walking through the narrow corridors and dimly lit cells, I could almost feel the weight of the stories held within these walls. (Yes - get the audioguide...it is Sooo worth it)  The personal accounts, photographs, and artifacts brought the history to life in a way that was both educational and emotional.\n\nOne of the most poignant sections of the museum is dedicated to the American POWs who were held here. The exhibits do an excellent job of conveying the harsh realities they faced, as well as the resilience and camaraderie that helped them endure. It’s a stark reminder of the human spirit’s capacity to withstand even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nWhat struck me most was the contrast between the prison's grim past and the bustling, vibrant city that surrounds it today. It’s a powerful testament to the passage of time and the progress that has been made. This place is not just a museum; it’s a place of reflection and remembrance, offering valuable lessons about history, resilience, and the importance of peace.\n\nIf you’re in Hanoi, I highly recommend a visit. It’s a profound journey through history that will leave you with a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s past and a greater appreciation for the present.",

                                   "If you’re in Hanoi, you have to visit this prison. The prison was built in Hanoi by the French. It was intended to hold Vietnamese prisoners, particularly political prisoners agitating for independence who were often subject to torture and execution. It gave me very great insights into the life of Vietnamese revolutionaries during the First Indochina War. I’ve learned the Hà Nội history  through this place and it gave me a very deep impression and valuable lesson.",

After getting on board of cruise we had lunch which was good and after that we stopped at one island where there was option of hiking or swimming. We did hiking which was tough and excruciating but view from above was worth it. After that second stop was there where there was option of Kayaking or Bamboo boat and we chose Kayaking which was awesome experience and last stop was the caves. Caves were fabulous and worth seeing.",

We can meet former residents of fishing villages when the boat leaning on a pier near the caves.\n\nIt is not as we we expected. The distance, the view of the cave is not meet our expectations. If you look closely, you will turns out that the dirty water -even though the color is still green-. There was some kind of oil layer, floating at top of the water, some sort of waste that might have come from our boats. With this water conditions, I don't know if it's safe to swim here.

Learn to cook spring rolls. Fish in the sea. And in the morning you will visit a pearl farm and enjoy kayaking in the bay.\nA mesmerizing experience.",

On our boat we had great food and a cooking demonstration which we found participate in.

                                   "A beautiful paradise on earth.. it has got 1969 limestone mountains that you can visit... Kayaking can be done.. cruise on the ship. May be stay overnight... Visit the amazing caves, it has got 3 chambers.. 3rd one is one of the biggest in the world.. you got uphill to trek.. a nice beach to take a swim... One thing i didn't like is the commercialization and the rude behaviour of the boys who hand over the photos taken inside the cave.. you see a sign board stating a free gift available (A small key chain with your photo on it). Towards your exit, you'll have few boys trying to sell u a A5 photo of yours and charge 10$. Pure scam !!! Avoid that and you can still collect you Free Key chain photo. ..",

The city looked like a bustling Las Vegas, but we were disappointed that we couldn't stay overnight. The caves we visited were full of adventure, and kayaking was an exhilarating experience. The view from the mountain top on Ti Top island was absolutely breathtaking, and even though the trek was challenging, it was completely worth it.",

Views are incredible and when you hike up to the mountain it looks even more surreal.. for kayaking it is included in the package when you take one from Hanoi.

It highlights the resilience and ingenuity of the Vietnamese people during the war and provides insight into how they lived under the ground for so many years. Getting to actually go into the tunnels is an incredible experience. The entrances are so well hidden and the tunnels narrow, even after they’ve been widened for tourists. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it was the second time I’ve been. Highly recommend taking the time to visit.",

But there is not much around it.\nThe price, by the way, is 125,000 dong, tour guide is included but with moderate English and not much info, just leads you through the tunnels and explains every few meters what tigers or no idea.\nOn the rest of the plant speaks as good as no one English. Caution at the shooting range, you may not hold the gun itself, is mounted in front, which takes the whole fun.\nEven with Google translate you do not get on here. A bit of a shame but well finally everyone must decide for themselves whether it is worth a full day with bus rides and in tunnel sightseeing.\n\nAfter the tunnel tour, you should explore the area yourself. There are far more places to see, but people usually wave it off and think that there are only the tunnels.",

We took the guided tour , so didn’t had to worry about buying the tickets .\nOur guide Superstar Jason gave us detailed information about the tunnels , its history and facts . We were able to finish the tour with the lunch in 2 hours .\nIt left us impressed for the Vietnamese people, and their intelligence in building these amazing tunnels and traps . We also went inside few tunnels to experience how it was felt .",

Cost is 60,000 VND for one bullet and you have to take minimum 10. It also cannot share with others.\n\nOverall it’s a great experience and you should not miss if you are in Ho Chi Minh City.",

There is little shelter between buildings, and so it is advisable to bring an umbrella to fend off the sun. It is a historical place, but not overly impressive. A guided tour is recommended to appreciate the history and significance of some of the buildings and rooms.",

Unfortunately one of the main buildings was closed due to restoration but there was still plenty to see.\nThere is an arts and crafts shop which was lovely and we had the opportunity to make some incense. They also run workshops there and would recommend checking it out.",

From the grand gates and towering walls to the peaceful courtyards and royal palaces, it’s easy to get lost in the magic of it all. ✨\n\nThe intricate architecture and vibrant colors are stunning, but what really steals the show are the hidden gems—like the quiet corners perfect for a moment of zen, and the ancient artifacts that give you a peek into the past. 🌸\n\nPro tip: wear a cute outfit and take lots of pictures. Bring lots of sunscreen and an umbrella to protect you from the hot sun🌞 👑",

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most important historical landmarks in the country. The citadel is a sprawling complex of palaces, temples, gardens, and other structures, all surrounded by a massive wall.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the scale and grandeur of the citadel. It is clear that the Nguyen Dynasty, which ruled Vietnam at that time, invested a great deal of time and resources into building and maintaining this impressive complex.\n\nSome of the highlights of the citadel include:\n\n- The Ngo Mon Gate, also known as the Meridian Gate, is the main entrance to the citadel. It is a massive gate with five arches, each of which represents a different social class.\n- The Thai Hoa Palace was the throne room of the Nguyen emperors. It is a large and impressive building with a golden roof and intricate carvings.\n- The Imperial Garden is a beautiful garden with a variety of flowers, trees, and ponds. It is a great place to relax and escape the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nTips for visiting:\n\n1. The citadel is a large complex, so it is best to wear comfortable shoes and clothing.\nBring a hat and sunscreen, as it can get quite hot in the sun.\n2. There are several restaurants and cafes inside the citadel, but it is also a good idea to bring your own snacks and drinks.\n3. There are English-speaking tour guides available, which can be helpful for learning more about the history of the citadel.\n4. Allow at least 3-4 hours to visit the entire citadel.",

You walk at your own leisurely place and explore in depth whatever catches your fancy. There are shops inside the palace selling refreshments and souvenirs too. One of the palace buildings was under construction too.",

If you're planning to visit both, I highly recommend getting a combo ticket which include the audioguide fee as well.\n\nIf you're into country's rich history this is one of great places to check out!",

                                   "Reunification Palace was the base of Vietnamese General Ngo Dinh Diem until his death in 1963. It made its name in global history in 1975. A tank belonging to the North Vietnamese Army crashed through its main gate, ending the Vietnam War. Today, it's a must-visit for tourists in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe palace is like a time capsule frozen in 1975. You can see two of the original tanks used in the capture of the palace parked in the grounds. Reunification Palace was the home and workplace of the French Governor of Cochin-China. It has lush gardens, secret rooms, antique furniture, and a command bunker. It's still in use to host important occasions in Ho Chi Minh\"\n\nThis place is like stepping back in time. It is an excellent place to take in an understand what was happening in Vietnam at the time. The rooms and the informatoln boards and photos captures a dark time in the world. Definately worth a visit.",

It gives a great overview of the palace and history surrounding it. From there go to each floor and visit the beautiful rooms! I wish I did the audio tour because it felt like I was missing our on information that didn’t have written info plaques. A must see in Ho Chi Minh City!",

                                   "The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum that I visited is one of Vietnam's symbolic tourist attractions, and I was impressed by the beauty of the building and its decorations. Inside the building, I was able to learn about Ho Chi Minh's unknown facts along with the sanctity of the place. When entering the mausoleum, I was required to check my physical condition and was warned to pray quietly. In the surrounding park, you can reflect on your experience at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum while taking a break. However, it can get very hot and crowded with tourists during summer, so I recommend visiting on weekdays in the late afternoon. To understand the history and culture of Vietnam, please be sure to visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.",

All major festivals or gatherings will be held here, and if tourists want to come here, they must dress formally to show respect. Mr. Ho Chi Minh\'s body is placed in the crystal coffin in the central hall, surrounded by troops guarding. In addition to the Ho Chi Minh Memorial Hall, there are also the Ho Chi Minh Museum and the One Pillar Pagoda in the southwest that can be visited.\n\nOpposite the Ho Chi Minh Memorial is the National Assembly. It is said that the arrangement was for the founding father, Ho Chi Minh, to hear that the National Assembly was in session and to continue to "lead" the Vietnamese government.\n\n(Original)\n胡志明紀念堂位於河內市中心，越南獨立之父胡志明就安息在這裡。凡是重大節日慶典或集會都會在這裡舉行，而遊客如果要來這裡拜訪，必須要穿著正式一些以示尊重。胡志明先生的遺體就放在中央大廳的水晶棺木中，四周有軍隊守護著。除了胡志明紀念堂外，西南方還有胡志明博物館、獨柱寺等可以去參觀。\n\n胡志明紀念堂的對面就是國會。據說這樣的安排是讓國父胡志明聽到國會在開會，並繼續“領導”越南政府。',

                                   "The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi, Vietnam, is one of the most significant historical and cultural landmarks in the country. It houses the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh, the revolutionary leader and former president who played a key role in Vietnam's fight for independence. The mausoleum is located in Ba Dinh Square, where Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence in 1945.\n\nArchitecturally, the mausoleum is an imposing granite structure, influenced by Lenin’s Mausoleum in Moscow, yet it incorporates distinct Vietnamese touches. The solemn atmosphere reflects the reverence the Vietnamese people hold for their national hero.\n\nVisitors, including foreigners, can enter the mausoleum and pay their respects. The experience is orderly and respectful, with a strict dress code and rules prohibiting photography inside. The line to enter is usually long, but it moves efficiently thanks to the disciplined guards.\n\nIf you get the chance to visit, entering the mausoleum is a profound experience, offering insight into Vietnam’s deep respect for Ho Chi Minh and its history. Keep in mind that the mausoleum is typically closed for maintenance for a few months each year (usually from September to November), so it's good to check ahead of time if you plan to go.",

However, you can actually see it while walking, so I think it takes about 20 seconds. Please note that it is only available in the morning and on certain days of the week. Also, there are a lot of Vietnamese people coming, so if you don't go early, you'll have to wait a long time. It is free of charge.",

Situated in a grand parade square, the mausoleum offers a solemn tribute to the revered leader of Vietnam. One of the highlights of the experience is witnessing the changing of the guard march, a ceremonial display open for everyone to observe.\n\nHowever, during my visit in 2023, access to Ho Chi Minh's preserved body was not possible due to maintenance. Despite this temporary restriction, the mausoleum still stands as a symbol of reverence and national pride, inviting visitors to pay their respects and learn about the life and legacy of this esteemed leader.",

Actually, nothing is too special about the lake. Just a Chinese temple in the middle of the lake. But, around the lake, there are numerous attractions from historical sites to hotels, food and beverages as well as shopping. As it is an iconic lake of Hanoi, tourists must visit here as the sign that you have been to Hanoi. At the lake side, you can sit and rest. Locals also organize gathering, picnic, event, etc. As it is within walking distance from Old Quarter, you may walk from your hotel at Old Quarter to this lake.",

During my recent visit to Vietnam's capital city, I had the pleasure of exploring this enchanting landmark, and it left a lasting impression on me.\nSurrounded by lush greenery and shaded walkways, Hoan Kiem Lake offers a peaceful escape from the bustling streets of Hanoi. Whether you're taking a leisurely stroll along its shores or sitting on one of the benches to admire the view, the tranquil ambiance of the lake is truly rejuvenating.The centerpiece of the lake is the iconic Turtle Tower, standing majestically amidst the shimmering waters. Legend has it that the tower is home to a sacred turtle, adding to the mystique and allure of the area.One of the highlights of my visit was crossing the charming red bridge to reach Ngoc Son Temple, located on a small island in the lake.\n\nThe temple's intricate architecture and rich history provided insight into Vietnam's cultural heritage and spirituality.Hoan Kiem Lake also serves as a vibrant hub for locals and tourists alike, with activities such as tai chi sessions, street performances, and traditional water puppet shows adding to its allure.Whether you're seeking solace in nature, immersing yourself in Vietnamese culture, or simply enjoying a leisurely day out, Hoan Kiem Lake offers an unforgettable experience that will leave you enchanted and inspired.Overall, my time spent at Hoan Kiem Lake was a highlight of my trip to Hanoi, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city",

The main one about Vietnamese 54 ethnic groups. There is another building about culture and things of South east Asia and other parts of the world l. And the most interesting one is the outdoor section with 1 to 1 scale actual houses.\n\nIt takes around 6 hours to completely see, read and understand the things. But you would not regret spending one whole day in this museum. It has many interesting facts and artifacts about Architecture, Design, Culture, Fashion , Religions and Ethnic groups.\n\nThe display and information is quite good compared to other museums in the region",

Probably with a guided your you can get more insights, but the information available in the descriptions was already a lot. The garden is also incredibly nice with all the different types of houses. Really a must see in Hanoi if you enjoy these types of museums.",

Also, they displayed kind of traditional buildings of Vietnamese people outside the museum. They are open to visitors and could directly feel their culture which was very good experience. The only drawback was that food here was so expensive and mostly not related to Vietnam stuff like pizza.\nI was fortunate to see water puppet here.

One building is for South East Asia more broadly, some works from all over the world, and a rotating exhibit (currently about everyday life in Korea). The second building is just about the different people of Vietnam.\n\nI learned so much through the signs in the South East Asia building about the pieces and how they relate to the culture.\n\nThe Vietnamese building was also interesting with some videos to watch - and it looked like you might be able to get an audio tour but I couldn’t see any signs to buy one.\n\nThe outdoor area was my favourite - but very hot as we went in summer. You can go into all the houses, and the signs explain what part of Vietnam the houses are from. There are also tombs and boats to look at, and lots of shade from all the trees.\n\nNote: To enter the homes, you must take your shoes off. Wear some easy to take on and off shoes! ☺️\n\nThere are 2 cafes, toilets and 2 souvenir shops too. For 40k ticket entrance, this is a must see. We really enjoyed our time and spent maybe 3 hours here, and got a hibiscus iced tea at the cafe after.\n\nOnly thing is getting a taxi when you leave is not super easy. We walked down the road a bit until we found one driving by.",

You can see artefacts, videos, images and read about so many different traditions, beliefs, customs and history. Available in 3 languages (Vietnamese, French and English) throughout. It also includes a wide variety of full sized homes that you can walk through and learn about, to find out how people live in different cultural groups. I loved it!",

                                   "Main destination in Hanoi!\n\nInteresting museum, especially garment history and architecture in mind. I loved being able to go into old stilt houses and studying the construction techniques.\n\nFew words of criticism:\n\nSignage is not very clear. I could not find a toilet in the new building and there was no one at the information desk. Had to use the restaurant toilet. WC signs are the most crucial part of a public building.\n\nLighting is poorly designed. The pieces could benefit from darker rooms with spots inside the cases. Often the TV monitors and lights are reflected in the glass and it's hard to see the objects.\n\nDo not miss the museum grounds! There are many wonderful old buildings there. Also note that the grounds have two museums. I thought there was just the old one and nearly missed the modern one entirely.\n\nGift shop:\nIt breaks my heart that they dismantle old museum quality native garments to make souvenirs like plush toys. Someone spent months lovingly hand embroidering and batique dying a piece of cloth that is now treated like rubbish. Sad fate to valuable old pieces of history.",

                                   "Ah, the buildings and gardens of this place, they are like whispers from the past, gently urging us to pause and reflect upon the journey of life. As I gaze upon these structures, I am reminded of the harmony that exists between the world of man and the world of nature. The architecture stands as a testament to the artistry of the human spirit, while the gardens, with their intricate design, beckon us to meditate upon the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nIn the midst of our bustling lives, it is easy to forget the significance of stillness. These surroundings, with their tranquil aura, serve as a reminder to cease the relentless march of time, if only for a moment. Here, the wind rustling through the leaves and the gentle babbling of water seem to whisper secrets of the universe, encouraging us to contemplate the true purpose of existence.\n\nMeditation becomes effortless amidst these surroundings, for the very essence of this place seems to invite introspection and contemplation. The gardens, meticulously nurtured, mirror the stages of life itself—birth, growth, decay, and renewal. As we wander through these sacred spaces, we are reminded of the impermanence of all things and the eternal cycle of change.\n\nThus, in this haven of tranquility, I find solace in the art of stillness and reflection. It is a sanctuary where one can stop time and ponder the profound questions that shape our existence. Let us heed the call of this place, for it whispers to us the wisdom of ages past, reminding us of the timeless pursuit of understanding the meaning of life.",

The are some stairs to negotiate to get to the temples but not a lot,it can get very crowded early in the morning 8-9am as this is when all the tour buses pull in, even on weekdays. They will lend you free of charge a gown to cover your legs / shoulders to enter the main temple if you happen to get Randomly picked for not wearing the appropriate clothes, I was picked for wearing shorts ( so l wore a gown) but I witnessed many others just going inside the main temple just wearing tang tops and shorts\n( I was wearing a collared shirt and knee length shorts) yes u can walk to this site from downtown takes around 30 minutes",

                                   "I was in awe of this historical temple. A few steps to climb to get to the top and once there, you can see the city overlook. Beautiful view from up there. Lots of picnic tables and chairs with shaded trees to keep you cool. You can also get some drinks and snacks from a local vendor and enjoy the view while sitting there and admire the temples. Highly recommend this place.",

Wouldn't say it's a tourist trap but these structures are the main attraction in Nha Trang so be prepared for a crowd. Not a whole lot to see- just three main buildings and a small exhibition on the restoration. Can complete in 30 minutes",

However, my experience was dampened by the persistent and high-pressure tactics of street vendors and drivers. Despite wanting to explore further, the constant sales pitches and negotiations at the temple gate were unpleasant. As a Vietnamese person, I felt disappointed by this behavior, particularly in the sacred space of a temple. Unfortunately, we left after less than 5 minutes as the atmosphere was not conducive to a positive experience.",

I said it is too expensive and then she gave me 50% discount (100k vnd). I said no. And she mentioned something related to Orphans without school and etc.\n\nLater on, I told her that I didn’t want the stuff that she was selling. But, I am willing to give her 50k vnd as a donation. Afterwards, she didn’t even say a “Thank” to me. What a person without gratitude. She is definitely someone who is targeting tourists for income!",

And if you come in the middle of the day, prepare to be pretty overheated once you reach the statue at the peak.  Bring water.  The view from the top is pretty outstanding actually, and hopefully you will have a nice breeze at we did.  There is a restroom onsite, however I would not recommend this ascent to anyone handicapped, as I did not see any elevators or such.",

There are areas where you need to be wearing long pants, but you can rent a sheet to cover your legs of needed. The topmost area doesn't need full leg covering, just the lower level temple. There's a nice cafe at the entrance, with very reasonable prices. Be sure to take the exit behind the temple (paved winding path downhill) that winds down the side streets for a view of several other temples.",

                                   "Don't judge the cathedral so much by my pictures! I went recently in July and it's still under construction but I also attended the English mass on Sunday which was a lovely experience! Wasn't as hot as I expected thanks to all the fans. The sound system I think needs some upgrade as even though I was quite close to the podium/centre with the priest, the speakers or whatever equipment were a bit too echo-y so was difficult to understand the speakers at times.\n\nI MUST SAY: the cathedral's choir and singers are EXCELLENT. Harmonizing and all that? wow. And the young woman who did the responsorial psalm when I went - *chefs kiss* simply angelic. I wish the whole mass was sung by her. I would recommend attending their mass JUST for the music.",

                                   'In downtown Ho Chi Minh City, an important remnant of the French colonial period in Vietnam - the "Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception", most commonly known as "Notre-Dame Cathedral". It was built, between 1863 and 1880, by French Roman Catholics and was simply known as the "Church of Saigon". It is a neo-romanesque construction, with an all-red brick facade, two outstanding bell towers, six bronze bells and beautiful stained-glass windows. In 1959, a granite statue of Virgin Mary, depicted as "Our Lady of Peace", was brought from Italy and placed at "Paris Square", also known as "Notre-Dame Square", which is right in front of the ancient church. Immediately after, the "Church of Saigon" was designated as the city\'s Cathedral. It has been undergoing severe restoration works and has been closed to visitors for already a long time. Stroll along and try to imagine how beautiful it certainly is, a true landmark of the Roman Catholic presence in Southeast Asia. Enjoy!\nRead more',

I asked some people seated next to me about the time of the mass and what language would be used. Learned that It would start at 9:30 am and language to be used is English.\n\nAfter the mass, I walked behind the Altar area. There are statues of saints in this area as well as in both sides of the front section. Outside are small gardens with flowering plants and a statue of Mary.\n\nOn the outside, it is a very beautiful and magnificent cathedral. At the entrance, it was in harmony with the statue of Mary, and it was a shame that I could not see the inside because it was under construction. I really want to see the inside when I get the next opportunity, so I moved to another place with regret.",

Last year we got the opportunity to see the Notre-Dame in Paris however unfortunately it was undergoing renovations so we didn't get to really see it or go inside.\n\nSo you can imagine our disappointment when we came to the Notre-Dame in Saigon and realised that it was under renovation.... Its clearly an iconic and grand building but we didn't get to really experience it",

As to the tea shop, it is the brainchild of a Saigon native French educated economist, Dan Tranh.\nAs I expressed interest in Jasmin tea, he invited me to have some with him, from jasmine flowers harvested by him from his own garden. We chatted about his time in France, his numerous trips in Vietnam 🇻🇳 to the various tea growing regions, where artisanal methods are still used. His knowledge of tea making is vast and precise. His shop is lovely, and very inviting. It is encounters like this that make traveling such a rewarding experience! Highly recommended!",

Not only specific Vietnam culture, but also Kambodian, Chinese, Sino-Tibetian represented there, as it has it's place on this country.

Located in District 1, the museum is housed in a beautiful French colonial-style building that dates back to 1929. While not a large museum, it packs a punch with its well-curated exhibits that cover various aspects of Vietnamese history.\n\nOne of the highlights is the collection of artifacts from the Bronze Age Dong Son civilization, which emerged around 2000 BCE. The museum also features relics from the Funan, Cham, and Khmer civilizations, as well as a fine collection of Buddha statues. Visitors can also see a perfectly preserved mummy of a local woman who died in 1869.\n\nThe museum does an excellent job of illustrating the evolution of Vietnamese culture, from ancient times to the present day. The exhibits are well-labeled and informative, with good English translations. While there are no specific exhibits on the great battles of the past, the museum provides a comprehensive overview of Vietnam's history.\n\nOverall, the History Museum of Ho Chi Minh City is a great way to learn about Vietnam's fascinating past. The beautiful colonial architecture and well-curated exhibits make it a must-see for anyone visiting the city.",

In fact, it's odd that it's called the \"Hochiminh City History\" museum, since it  covers the history of all areas of ancient Vietnam, says little about Saigon, and is more an art than a history museum. It has a fantastic collection of Hindu sculptures, and a small but beautiful courtyard garden. If I'd known what was here, I would have put it first on my list of worthwhile places to visit.

                                   "By far the best museum in HCMC! I found it not too big or small, the price is right, and the depth and variety is great. Some of it is a bit old and self-congradualtory, but most of it is well framed. Loved the chronological setup, as well as the featuring of other cultures!",

                         "The Cau Temple is a notable 18th-century wooden bridge adorned with intricate carvings and a pedestrian walkway. It serves as an iconic landmark of Hoi An, originally built by the Japanese community in the late 16th century to connect with the Chinese neighborhoods. Despite some modifications over time, it has retained much of its original Japanese aesthetic design. Recently restored to its arched shape in 1986, the bridge is currently undergoing repairs and may not be accessible at times.",

Not sure what it looks like during the day but it's pretty at night, and only a block away from the Thu Bon River where there are lots of lantern boats and restaurants.  It's a good ending to the short walk from the fabric district and Hoi An market.",

                                   "Chua Cau, also known as the Japanese Covered Bridge, is a true architectural marvel in Hoi An, Vietnam. This iconic bridge is a testament to the rich history and cultural heritage of the town.\n\nStepping onto Chua Cau is like stepping back in time. The bridge's intricate design, featuring a combination of Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese architectural elements, is nothing short of mesmerizing. It's a perfect example of the harmonious fusion of different cultures that Hoi An is known for.\n\nThe bridge's significance in the local folklore adds an extra layer of charm. It's said to have been built by the Japanese community in the 17th century as a symbol of peace and goodwill. The statue of two dogs and two monkeys guarding the bridge is a unique touch that sparks curiosity and imagination.\n\nWalking across Chua Cau allows you to soak in the serene beauty of Hoi An's ancient streets. The views of the Thu Bon River from the bridge are picturesque, making it a popular spot for photographers and travelers alike.\n\nWhat I truly appreciate about Chua Cau is its role as a historic landmark that has been lovingly preserved. It's a symbol of Hoi An's dedication to maintaining its cultural heritage. The nearby temple, dedicated to the Taoist deity Tran Vo Bac De, adds to the spiritual aura of the area.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a photography enthusiast, or simply looking for a peaceful and reflective spot in Hoi An, Chua Cau is a must-visit. It's not just a bridge; it's a timeless link to Hoi An's past and a source of inspiration for all who cross its elegant arches. Don't miss the chance to experience its beauty and significance when you're in this enchanting town.",

I was really amazed by the old architecture and how preserved it is. The atmosphere with the river, floating boats, and lanterns that are everywhere is just simply amazing. Worthy of spending here even a few days instead just of a night. Thank you😍",

Qualitywise and when it comes to cleanliness there is a bit lacking. But if you just want to have some cheap beer, listen to live music and see a lot of people, then this is the place for you. Great for backpackers I guess!",

I find the so famous "beer street" to be too crowded and noisy to actually have a conversation so this was a perfect spot to drink and chill. I like ordering jugs just because sharing it makes it more special. Encounter really nice local people',

                                   "Stepping into the Vietnam National Museum of History, I embarked on a journey through the rich tapestry of Vietnam's past. Each exhibit, meticulously curated and thoughtfully presented, offered a glimpse into the nation's storied history and cultural heritage.\n\nAs I wandered through the halls, I was struck by the resilience and strength of the Vietnamese people in the face of adversity. From the struggles against foreign colonization to the trials of war and conflict, the museum's exhibits illuminated the triumphs and tribulations of generations past.\n\nOne exhibit, in particular, left a profound impact on me. It chronicled the human cost of war, showcasing artifacts and personal stories that spoke to the courage and sacrifice of those who fought and perished in defense of their homeland. Standing before the relics of a bygone era, I was overwhelmed by a wave of emotion, my heart heavy with sorrow for the lives lost and the suffering endured.\n\nYet, amidst the darkness of war and conflict, there were also moments of hope and resilience. Another exhibit celebrated the vibrant cultural heritage of Vietnam, showcasing traditional arts, crafts, and customs passed down through generations. Here, I found solace in the beauty and richness of the country's cultural legacy, a testament to the enduring spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nLeaving the museum, I couldn't shake the weight of the experience from my mind. It was a poignant reminder of the fragility of peace and the resilience of the human spirit. But above all, it was a call to action, urging me to remember the lessons of the past and strive for a future of peace, understanding, and reconciliation.",

We recommend spending more time in the second building since it has a lot more information.\n\nStudent discount is available.",

                                   "Took us a few hours to wander around this museum. There are two separate buildings and one is for the ancient Vietnam exhibits (which is pretty impressive) and the other is for post-1945 Vietnam (French revolution, etc).\n\nThey have a vast collection of pre-historic artifacts dating back to the Stone Age; it’s obvious that Vietnam has excellent archeological efforts.\n\nThese are really old buildings built during the French rule so it’s a bit creepy walking around dark corridors and spaces, and some areas aren’t well-ventilated, although I think it adds to the experience while looking at ancient mystic objects, i felt like it added to the thrill..:)\n\nOverall, a must-visit if you like history and art. And who doesn’t? 🙃",

Google maps will direct you to the building about modern Vietnamese history, but to go in chronological order you need to go across the road to the other building to start with prehistoric Vietnam. I’ve included a photo of the correct building to start at below.\n\nOther than that, the museum is OK. The prehistory room was very good, but once I got to the room about Chinese influence and the development of Vietnam as a country, the descriptions and explanations became very confusing and it was really hard to tell what the items on display showed. I kind of didn’t get the sense of Vietnamese history that I’d hoped for.",

The struggles they went through were just insane.\n\nThe items in the museum have been looked after and are in such great condition. Just loved the old school cupboards with the mother of pearls. The mesuem also offers audio files for each of the pieces so make sure to take some headphones to listen.\n\nThe meusem area is very large and open. It is both child friendly as well as caiters for people with disabilities.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting the natural History museum.",

The designer is usually present so you might be able to chat with her about the house's unique concept.",

You can easily get lost but that makes it fun. Be careful as you climb the stairs as some are very narrow and hand rails are short and these stairs can be very high so one stupid move and you could fall and hurt yourself badly. We only saw 1 staff at the front of the entrance. Lots of photo opportunities. Make sure you explore everything. They even have rooms for rent if you dare and they are still adding new additions.",

If you’re going with kids make sure to stay close to them as there are many thin paths which are pretty dangerous if they fall as it is pretty high up. Anyone can come here and have a pretty good time. I definitely wouldn’t recommend staying in the actual hotel though as it is very touristy and we were easily able to look into rooms.",

There alot of stairs that go up and down all over the place. There is also a large garden and weird statues and sculptures. It’s a must visit if you like seeing weird and unusual things. You can cover the whole place in around 30-40mins.\n\nBe warned that some stairs are very dangerous so try and see where they go before you decide to use those stairs. Some stairs don’t have hand rails and can go up 3 stories so you don’t want to be climbing those stairs because if you slip, it’s a death sentence. The height of the steps are also not uniform so you can trip easily so walk slowly. I don’t recommend this place if you are elderly. If you have kids, keep a close eye on them otherwise an accident can be waiting to happen.",

                                   "I recently had the opportunity to visit a stunningly designed architectural masterpiece and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. The building boasts a sleek and modern design, with clean lines and an efficient use of space. The attention to detail in every aspect of the architecture was phenomenal, from the carefully curated materials used to the thoughtfully placed windows and skylights that allowed natural light to flow in.\n\nOne of the standout features of this place was the harmonious blend of indoor and outdoor spaces, creating a seamless connection between the building and its surroundings. The exterior of the building was equally impressive, with its contemporary style and beautiful landscaping adding to the overall aesthetic.\n\nThe interiors were just as breathtaking, with a minimalist yet warm and inviting feel. Every room was tastefully decorated, and the use of natural materials such as wood and stone added to the serene atmosphere. The open plan layout allowed for a great flow of movement throughout the building, and the well-placed artwork and accents added a touch of sophistication.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the building was incredibly practical and efficient, with state-of-the-art amenities and systems in place to ensure a comfortable and convenient experience for all visitors.\n\nOverall, this architectural marvel truly embodies the perfect balance between form and function, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and inspiring place to visit. It truly is a feast for the senses, and I cannot wait to return.",

                                   "Bizarre and fascinating. We loved exploring the Crazy House especially walking along the narrow, abstract, and meandering staircases that lead to other mini pockets of madness. If you like art or wacky things, you must visit this place.\n\nThis place gets super busy at all times with intrigued visitors alike, so be prepared for traffic as you marvel at the structures and scenes this house has to offer. There’s also a place to grab a bite and coffee that is semi-attached to the garden area of Crazy House - Crazy Coffee. A nice place to take a moment after exploring the madness of this place.\n\nIn all honesty we were apprehensive about visiting this place as we tend to stray from the overly touristic activities whilst travelling, but I felt compelled to see the Crazy House as I love bizarreness. Although very touristy, it didn’t take away from the experience and I’d definitely recommend visiting here regardless.\n\nUseful info:\n\n- 60,000 Dong to enter.\n- Purchase a ticket from the tiny booth just to the left of the entrance before you proceed. We noticed a fair few people being confused as to where tickets are possessed as it kind of looks like just another part of the building as opposed to a kiosk.",

It's like a maze of different architecture pieces and buildings.\nOnly let downs was some of it doesn't seem to be quite finished - random cement and paint left around unattended. Also the \"history of...\" room - no actual information it seems about the construction or design, just a ton of photos (it does include some development photos) of people and no explanations as to who they are or why they are important - could definitely improve here especially for foreign visitors.\n\nOtherwise definitely worth a few hours to visit!",

We were in the ‘termite room’ which was the most special place I have ever slept! We had a fireplace and the whole room was covered in wood. It was very cozy indeed. The best thing about our stay however, were the absolutely incredible people working there, namely Hannah and the lady that made us breakfast! (We didn’t catch her name) their sweetness really added to the feeling that we were in some kind of fairy tale! We tried to tip Hannah several times but she would not accept, and said that she would instead prefer a hug! She is really such a kind and lovely person 😌 we really were made to feel at home at Crazy House, and we were astounded by the incredible architecture of Dang Viet Nga, I wish more architects around the world would have such a spectacular and whimsical vision of how the world should look, I think it would make the world a much happier place!\nP.s\nI CANT BELIEVE IT IS LISTED AS A 1 STAR HOTEL!! (in our opinion) THIS WAS BETTER THAN 5 STAR HOTELS WE HAVE STAYED IN!!",

It is because the whole place is a maze of stairs. If you want to challenge finding every room, stamina must be good, not scared of height, and strong healthy knees.\n\nThe stairs is narrow, the handle is low, and you expect tourist from different direction. So for those that have weak or injured knees, it will be a big struggle.  For those that scared of height, the handle is low and you have to move away to let the tourist flow smoothly.\n\nI can only say the designer is a genius, but there are few areas which are a bit eerie.\n\nOverall. Totally worth the visit. I don't post the inside to avoid any spoiler. You just go there and explore.",

The ticket cost 80,000 dong, and it took us about an hour to explore the area (in the rain) - to climb up the stairs, go down to the garden, enjoy the view from the top, and explore all the crazy designs. Despite the large number of visitors at the same time, we were still able to enjoy it quietly. Highly recommended!",

We stayed in termite room which was quite small and bathroom basic but a really great price and qwerky and there are other bigger rooms you can chose. There was a mosquito plug in to keep them away in the night . Was great to be able to roam around early or later in the evening around the place when visitors have left. It's worth staying for the experience!",

Thank you for your kindness. Most of the hotel staff cannot speak English, but they are responsive to your needs. The room is warmly designed, the hotel owner is indeed a great architect. Even though the air outside the room is cold, when entering the room, you will feel warm. Even the floor will not make your feet cold. The bathroom water flows swiftly and smoothly, the hot water works well. This hotel is a must-visit place for tourists in Da Lat. You can meet local and international tourists from all over the country here. So, you cannot avoid the crowds during the day. Even some guests knock, trying to enter your room even though the hotel staff has put up a sign that the room is occupied. You also have to lock your room every time you leave the room.",

Besides this, we noticed there was not much traffic as most locals take a tunnel below to get to the other side quicker.\nWe found ourselves stopping on a number of occasions as every turn offered a new picturesque view to take in.\nOn the way up you will see a number of locals with small coffee/ snack stalls set up & table areas to relax at.\nI’d advise going to these over the cafes on top who can be a little overbearing when trying to get you into their place.\nWe found a great family run stall on the way, which was so peaceful & offered what we thought was the best view.",

Gorgeous on the way up, through the pass, and back down. You might even see some endangered quoc monkeys and cows like we did!\n\nGet yourself a scooter and head up in the morning, preferably around 7 am if you want to beat the crowds heading up the mountain. It's entirely a scenic tour, but if you have the time to spare for a peaceful drive then go for it. You'll be glad you did.",

I was disappointed, but probably only because it's unnecessarily hyped. Nice windy road, albeit with too much heavy vehicle traffic. Some decent views of the beaches and inevitable tourist stop offs. Not a special drive.",

Der höchste Pass Vietnams verbindet Hue mit Da Nang und schlängelt sich 20 Kilometer lang über die Ausläufer des Truong-Son-Gebirges. Häufig ist er in Wolken eingehüllt, deshalb auch Wolkenmeer genannt, doch ich hatte großes Glück und die Sonne strahlte. So boten sich während der Fahrt spektakuläre Ausblicke auf dichten Dschungel, traumhafte Buchten und einsame Sandstrände in Richtung Südchinesisches Meer. An der Spitze liegen noch Reste alter Bunkeranlagen aus der Zeit des Indochinakriegs. Statt den 6 km langen Tunnel zu nehmen, würde ich immer die Passüberquerung empfehlen.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nMy car ride over the Hải Vân Pass was beautiful. Vietnam's highest pass connects Hue with Da Nang and winds 20 kilometers over the foothills of the Truong Son Mountains. It is often shrouded in clouds, which is why it is also called a sea of ​​clouds, but I was very lucky and the sun was shining. During the journey there were spectacular views of dense jungle, beautiful bays and lonely sandy beaches towards the South China Sea. At the top there are still remains of old bunkers from the time of the Indochina War. Instead of taking the 6 km long tunnel, I would always recommend crossing the pass.",

I stayed on a Friday and Saturday so maybe that was it, but very noisy groups of people in the alleyway below well into the early hours, which really disrupted my sleep. There are a lot of hotels on this street so maybe that was it, with people coming in late drunk etc. If you're sensitive to noise then make sure you bring a good pair of earplugs, or take a room not facing the street without a window perhaps.",

(Could use a bit more pressure, but that's normal here). Breakfast was cooked to order with several different options including western breakfast. Also, the people that worked here were fantastic. They helped book tours, gave recommendations, and helped with directions (all with great english). Great 3 night stay here!",

We need a ticket from the Ancient Town admission tickets to enter. There are beautiful decorations inside the colourful building. It is also cool inside, just nice to take a rest from the hot sun outside. It is one of the must-visit sites here. Recommendable.",

They don’t sell individual clothes or shorts, making it clear that only wholesale purchases are available. However, we managed to buy luggage, coffee, and some adorable animation backpacks for my daughter.\n\nInteraction with the store was mixed. Some didn’t respond at all to our inquiries, while others politely declined. It was like playing a game of “Guess Who?” with the staff. Nonetheless, we found the coffee to be of superior quality and better prices than Ben Thanh Market. We appreciated the lack of pressure from the seller—finally, a place where we can enjoy our coffee without the hard sell!\n\nOne store owner informed us that brand of coffee beans, which I showed her in photos, was of poor quality despite its higher price.\n\nGuess even bad coffee can come with a high price tag!\n\nOverall, it’s a great market if you’re interested in buying food items like nuts, coffee, dried fruits, and dried seafood in bulk.",

Usually they just sell in wholesale , won’t entertain retail customers , but few of them will give you in retail . Unlike other markets probably there is no bargaining and the prices are fixed. Happy shopping 🤟🏻",

The nuts here are cheaper and price are mainly fixed. We got a few kilos of cashews and macadamia here. The dried shrimp looks fresh and good colour, so we got some as well.\n\nIn terms of food which is at the back lane, it doesn’t look so appetizing for us so we venture out and stumbled upon a great squid noodle place nearby\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/1QUNdpbFiuhJbWcd6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy",

In my opinion, this market has way more stuff than benh than market and the store owners won't hassle you for purchase. There's a whole array of food items, bags, kitchen items, clothing, dried food items, snacks, cosmetics, etc etc.",

Please don't try to bargain if you come here. They give good prices to begin with and get offended if you bargain. There are even signs against it. The only downside is that they don't speak English. But you can communicate numbers via your phones.",

Only at the very end they let you walk on small piece of land.\nPay attention, that to buy entrance tickets you need to go on boat station which is about 5 km away from cave. There is no way to buy tickets near cave!",

It is one of the most spectacular places on earth, still undiscovered by most outside of Vietnam, so if you're reading this, the time to come is now! A ton of options for different ages and adventure levels. Also, stay at the Phong Nha Farmstay and do everything they suggest, especially the friendly and safe Easy Rider moto tour and stop at Paradise Cave and Mooc Spring (eat lunch there) within the national park. You will not be disappointed!",

                                   "This is one of a must visit place for a vietnam trip. From here you can visit the Paradise cave, take a boat ride into the Phọng Nha cave, visit the Hien Lương bridge and the demarcation line which separated the North and South vietnam during the infamous Vietnam War.\nYou can reach phong nha by train, bus or plane. We took a flight from HCM city to Đồng Hới; the train and bus from different cities also end here. You should have contact your homestay or hotel, they will pick you up at the airport, train or bus station.\nFor food, there are a few options for western foods; Google is your best friend to search a place to eat. We stayed at the Sondoong homestay within walking distance to the boat ride to phong Nha cave.\nAnother good option is the Victoria Road homestay next door to Sondoong homestay. The Victoria is owned by an Australian with lots of experience exploring phong nha by bike.\nThe restaurant is pretty nice and cozy with some good western dishes and decent pizzas. There are also other places but this is the only places we ate during our time here.\nThere are a lot of places to stay in phọng nha, many tours are offered to fit your schedule. Overall, there is no 5 star accommodation and be prepared for the unexpected. But I can assure you this is a well worthy trip and enlighten your perspective.\nThe scenery is beautiful and truly reflect the live of the rural vietnam. This lifestyle has not changed for the last 60 years.\nLife is still tough for a lots of local people, tourism brings some relief to this corner of the world and they are welcome and appreciated.\nI also wanted to visit the demarcation line separated the north and south up to 1975. I have to say, for me at least, is a disappointment. The bridge is in shameful, neglected conditions with pealed paints, rotten wood planks on both sides of the bridges. I am not sure how to interpret the intentions here. Like it or not, this is a piece of history should be preserved. Either maintain it or tear it down !\nFor history bluffs, this city in right on the Ho Chi Minh trail, the road the north Vietnamese armies and supplies were moving south to attack the southern government. The old dirt roads are paved now but i can tell it is not a smooth road even today; small road barely fit 2 cars in opposite directions.\nFrom here you can visit Khe Sanh, where some well known battle grounds took place during the so called American war. Sorry I can’t help to draw a comparison to the south Vietnamese situation then and the Ukrainian ones now; they all relied on the support of the American and at the mercy of the support of the American politicians who only cares about themselves and/or their idiotic party lines. They withholding the last aid in 1975 and eventually abandoned the South. I hope the Ukrainian will fare better this time.\n\nKhe Sanh is now a city, I found virtually nobody has any knowledge about the war.\nIf you want to know more or feel adventurous, the owner of Victoria Road can help fulfill your quest.\nI loved this trip. It is a bit rough for us, since she is wheelchair bound but we made it",

The tickets were 150,000 vnd per person to enter the cave.\n\nThe boat price was a little more tricky. Its around 500,000 vnd for a boat which can take 1-12 people, but the more people you have the cheaper it is because you can split the bill as the price is for the entire boat and not per person.\n\nIf you have the money I would recommend travelling there by boat as you get to see more of the cave and you don't have to walk a great distance, especially in the summer heat.\n\nThe boats also depend on the weather and the water level. The cave system is connected to Laos so if there was a lot of rain recently in Laos, it will travel through the cave system into Vietnam, making the water levels rise and the cave not accessible by boat. I got lucky 😄",

The communication was very fast via WhatsApp. Mr. Mung  delivered it to where the bus dropped us and also rode to the gas station with us. I once had a question and Mr. Mung offered me a video call right away to figure it out. When we left Mr. Mung also picked it up again where our bus stopped.\nThe motorcycle fits two people with ease and is great to ride on narrow, bumpy and steep roads. We even fitted all our luggage, two backpacks and two smaller backpacks, on the back of the motorcycle and in the bags on the side of it.\nThe motorcycle was really nice and the service was excellent! Would recommend and rent again. Thank you very much.",

We worked remotely during the day and explored the city center at night.\n\nWe stayed in Sapa for about five days and rented a motorbike from Mr. Mung. He was exceptionally kind and even offered us a discount. His responsiveness was impressive, especially when we needed to rent a bike quickly for dinner after work. He went out of his way, even cutting his dinner short, to accommodate us.\n\nOn our last day in Sapa, we were supposed to return the bike by 8 PM. However, it was a busy day as we were preparing to leave for Ninh Binh. I informed Mr. Mung in advance that we might be a bit late, and he was very understanding, allowing us to return the bike after dinner without any issues.\n\nMr. Mung's kindness and hospitality truly enhanced our stay in Sapa. Meeting such a hospitable and accommodating business owner made our trip even more memorable.\n\nHighly recommended!",

Entry is 40k, audio guide is 50k although I didn’t go for it.\n\nThere’s a lot to see so I’d recommend carving out a good hour or two to get through it all. Even if you breeze through a few rooms, the museum’s layout is rather confusing and it’s easy to miss something incredible hidden away. My advice is to work floor by floor and be careful not to miss the rooms hidden at the  far ends of every corridor.\n\nSignage could do with some work.",

This is by far the most up-to-date and worthwhile one. The rest you can skip.\n\nIF you are into ancient and contemporary art mixed with historical facts, this is the place for you.\n\nImportant notes:\n1. Have a meal before you head over so that you will have patience to enjoy each painting or artifact.\n2. Get the audio guide. (50,000, you can get one and share it by putting your phone on speaker).\n3. Save at least 90 - 120mins to explore.\n4. Bring a bottle of water.\n\nThis is a good time to visit this museum as they are having a Japanese doll exhibition too.\n\nMAKE ART, NOT WAR 🎨",

I think when most people think of fine arts, we think of the masterpieces of the western Old Masters like Rembrandt, stunning paintings on canvas. But the moment you enter here, you are treated to a surprise—elaborate sculptures cut from rock meant to adorn pagodas, wooden painted buddhas larger than life, and the most enthralling lacquer paintings filled with more detail than a where’s waldo page. And yes there are plenty of incredible paintings in oil in the western style, but the plethora of these other works in other mediums created a shift in my mind: fine arts is not limited to the Western ideals. Was really eye-opening for me. The museum is also much bigger than it initially seems. Good choice for a rainy day in Hanoi.",

I love to take my time and try to immerse myself in the multitude of worlds the artists have created and also try to put myself in their shoes - how it must’ve been for them during the creation process. Truly fascinating artworks. I could and should’ve spent the whole day there. Next time! My friend and I didn’t know it already closes at 5pm - we didn’t pay attention to the closing time. That’s what I’d recommend for you guys in the future - come earlier in the morning if you can! Then you can all the time of the world for the day and maybe even find time to do some output while getting so much input. Writing, sketching, drawing… one thing that annoyed me a bit was the massive amount of people in “beautiful” clothes that intend to be there to take an endless of amount of photos. It kind of does distract the moment of appreciation for art when those people take photos for such shallow reasons. But well, we live in that kind of time period now.",

The museum consists of two buildings connected with 3 floors on each side and a basement area.  The basement consisted  of interesting ceramics.  There were items from the 10th through the 16th century that were well preserved. Some were made of wood.  The sections I found stunningly beautiful were paintings on silk and those made with lacquer.  I watch a film on the process of using lacquer to create.  It takes time and much work to use this art form.  I appreciated the work much more. I loved the woodcuts and modern art.  There is information in english, but I to me, the audioguide was very helpful.  Once you finish the museum, you can cross the street to visit a temple.  I spent over three hours because there were so many beautiful pieces.",

It's an iconic building and mostly used as a pick up spot for tourists for various day trips.\n\nThe building reminds of the French architecture and well maintained till now. Also ideal as a good background for pictures.\n\nYou can find many people sitting here or taking pictures. The place in front of the opera is free and no vehicles are allowed to park.\n\nVery near from Hanoi's city center and other tourist spots.",

I couldn't figure out how to book online so headed to the box office and they still only do physical tickets with seating on a piece of paper (unsure if this is for all shows). I reserved a seat on the middle price range which was higher with a great view of the stage. seats are a little old and a bit uncomfortable after awhile but look beautiful. the cast in the performance were exceptional and the set design and costumes were great. the only thing was the person in charge of the translation on the screens was sometimes delayed so there'd be a lot of skipping over and missing out on what was being said/sung.",

I never want to see another tree or plant in my life!)\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe Trấn Quốc Pagoda was constructed in the 6th century, making it almost 1,500 years old. It is the oldest Buddhist temple in the city, with several lotuses carved into the stone walls. Lotuses symbolize several things: the beauty of nature in Vietnam, the purity of the mind/body/speech, the achievement of enlightenment.\n\nThe most interesting part about this place is it’s Bodhi Tree, Which was originally a cutting taken from the tree in India where the Buddha sat and taught. They also worship mothers here, which for them is a term for “female Buddhas”, or female gods.\n\nI went here last year, and although it was closed at the time of my visit, the clear reflection in the water is what makes it stand out. Definitely visit it at sunset for a magical experience :).\n.\n.\n.Sanat , heykel , müze , park , orman , arkeoloji , kitap,  resim,  kafe , çay",

You can easily walk or drive to the temple and there is a large parking lot close by. It is one of the few temples in Hanoi where you do not need to pay an entrance fee. Please notice that the smaller garden with the pagoda has its own opening hours.",

You can tell it was a very house when it served as such by the intricate carvings on the wood furniture.\n\nIt's pretty quick to tour, you could easily be done in 30 minutes, but for only 10,000 VND it's not going to break your bank.",

Here we can see how traditional Vietnamese house looks like, and the guide also explained to us about what's inside the house and also some interesting history.\n\nWas thinking if it'll be boring to walk around the city only to do some cafe hopping and then we got to experience this.

Make sure to give yourself 3-4 hours to have time to explore everything. Take the elevator UP, but take the stairs down. Conserve your energy for the plethora of hiking in the clouds",

The other 40k is some guide booklet with postcards, which you don't actually need since there are plenty of signs and maps boards once you get up. So unless you want the postcards, just ask for the lift ticket.\nThe temples and caves are nice and overall it's a nice hike.\n\nLook out for local stores who will offer to park your bike for 'free' in exchange for buying something small. Only that they don't have anything 'small' you'll be looking to spend from 150k and up. Thus you have 2 options: a) accept the parking and see it as a way to support the local economy which has been hardly hit during the pandemic, or b) keep driving until you reach the designated visitors parking.",

It’s been fun to return with friends and family who come visit us.\n\nA few tips to plan your visit. If you can go first thing in morning for less crowds but being there at 12 was super cool to see the light come into the large cave in the back of the complex.\n\nIt’s hot so bring hat and water but you will be able to buy drinks inside if you want. Would recommend good shoes (no flip flops) there are a lot of stairs and rocks to walk over and you don’t want to slip.\n\nYou can walk up and down mountain but I recommend the extra cost to take elevator especially going up. Walking down is not that bad if you want to safe some money.\n\nThis is good for all agree but could be hard for people with mobility issues.",

It was truly an amazing experience with breathtaking views of the city and definitely worth a visit.\n\nWhen planning your trip to Marble Mountain, it is advisable to come prepared with suitable footwear and dry wick clothing as the temperature can get quite hot. The tour itself takes approximately one hour, during which you will be treated to beautiful views from the top as well as inside the cave.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Marble Mountain if you ever find yourself in Vietnam. The panoramic views and unique cave formations make it an unforgettable experience.\n\nThank you for your attention, and I hope this information proves helpful in planning your future travels.",

It is quite a religious place and do wear long pants and covered shoes as the steps may be slippery. Spent around 2-3 hours here exploring, it is a good workout for sure. Do visit if you’re feeling adventurous and want to challenge yourself",

We spent a few hours for the admission price of around 40000 dong, so around £1.50.\nWe chose to climb the stairs and even though it was a warm and humid day, as well as busy, we’re glad we did.\nThe sculptures we saw looked fantastic, and lots of photogenic pagodas. Some looked a little worse for ware, but it added to the aesthetic of the place.\nWhen you get to a sign that talks about steep stairs, it actually means you’re going to climb through quite a tight cave! So only attempt if fit and able, and have good footwear as it’ll be slippery.\nOne of the caves you walk down in to is a brilliant picture spot with a bright ray of light shining in to the temple cave.\nWould come back here again if we had the chance.",

                                   "Beautiful Scenery!\nMarble Mountains located in Ngũ Hành Sơn, Đà Nẵng. It’s all natural rocky mountains with profound history.\nMountains are high but not hard to climb. It’s more like elevated walking paths unless you want to climb to the top then it’s challenging. However, there’s an elevator for those who do not want to climb.\nOn the base of the mountains there are thousands of shops which sell stones, marble souvenirs or even large statues of almost everything you can think of.\nIt’s worth to visit!!!",

Was very enjoyable but  it’s kind of work out and hot sunny day .sweat out.Overpriced marble souvenirs but the short hike was worth it.\n\nInteresting place to go,\nI’d choose a cooler day in hindsight but still well worth it.\nI’d also recommend doing as part of a tour group as you’ll learn a lot more and they’re super cheap so there’s no reason not to.\nLots of steps and I though really not that bad if you struggle from the couch to fridge this isn’t a activity for you, but normal people should be fine just take water, though in saying that there  is vendors up the top as well and an elevator.\nMake sure you go to the bottom are first “hell” as it very interesting natural cave\nCheers",

Caves go about Buddhist statues debating the virtues of right and wrong, tying them to potential forms of punishment.\n\nCertain viewpoints are stunning, marble caves can be one of a kind, and stairways are well set. A bit of stair climbing is to be expected, set up an hour or two for exploring and experience at your own pace. Be mindful, visiting hours are until 5, go close to these hours to catch some beautiful sunset views on top (December).\n\nThe other side has an elevator up to the top directly which needs extra charge. Tourists can also walk up the stairs from the other side by themselves. There are temple, tower and Buddhism statues that can be seen. Suggest to take the elevator up and walk down.",

Really nice little walk. Bear in mind you have to be slightly fit to do this as there’s a lot of steps and steep climbs. You need to pay 40k per person for the mountain. Then 20k for a separate cave down the bottom. The Heaven staircase climb up is easy but down you’ll need to fit through some tight gaps. Also it is a marble mountain so it is a bit slippery",

The added value of having a knowledgeable tour guide cannot be overstated. They provided detailed insights into the history of why and how the mountain was built, as well as the types of stones used in its construction.\n\nOne fascinating aspect is the bullet holes in the stones of the walls, a stark reminder of the conflict between the Vietnamese people and the Americans, who were shooting at each other. Additionally, the holes in the cave at the top were created by bombs dropped by the Americans during the Vietnam War. This historical context added a deeper layer of appreciation for the site. Overall, Marble Mountain is a must-visit, combining natural beauty with a compelling historical narrative.",

Tickets for it all, including 1-way elevator ride will be 75k per person.\n\nIf you're looking to see it all, be ready for mild  exercise at least if you're not in great shape. You can see it all in about 1.5 hrs if you don't really stop for pictures, rest, or just to bask in the views. We spent about 2.5 hours and saw every bit of it at our own pace while taking photos everywhere.\n\nThe highest peak is tucked away behind the seating area near the restrooms, and walking up it is like going up a steep Stairmaster. I recommend it.\n\nBe sure to go into all the pathways for the main cavern at the base; it's a whole different vibe down there.",

Religious attire not necessary, and probably not the safest to wear a long skirt on all the stairs. Beware of people offering to take your photo or give you incense to burn as they will demand $$ afterwards. Just politely keep saying no and walking away. Lovely restaurant called SC restaurant and bar around the corner for some well earned lunch and a drink in the AC.",

Elderly and pregnant women do take note not to climb alone. And I do not recommend to visit during or after rain, as the steps are full of marble which can be very slippery When wet. There are various caves with the buddha statues within, there are maps for the mountain at the ticketing area as well if you need it.",

The makeup of the mountains is incredible, and it’s really worth seeing.\n\nYou head inside the cave which was really cool, but it was very warm inside so bear that in mind (we were very sweaty!)\n\nThere’s plenty of things to see inside including shrines and carvings in the walls. There were a lot of steep, steep stairs to viewpoints so take these routes at your own risk.\n\nThere are also some bats in the cave at the top of the mountain which was really cool to see!\n\nThe only downside is that in order to get to the top of the mountain, you have to pay extra for a lift ticket - which is fine, but you have to pay to go up, and then again to go down. We got the lift up, and then walked down instead to save a little bit of money.",

There are many sites worth visiting, so it's best to go either early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds and the heat. It takes about 2-3 hours to see everything. One thing to be cautious of is parking with the locals. They have stalls along the road and charge for motorcycle parking.",

There are several statues carved but this unique cave is so beautiful.\nMust visit place. You get to catch a small elevator upto 1/3rd of the mountain.  Rest you explore the place walking the steps.\n\nOnce you are done you climb down the mountain and end up to a place where there are lot of local vendors selling marble carved Buddhas and other sculptures. Suggestion is to buy little inside as the prices differ. We entered to one shop where she started off for a small statue for 1.2M dong. We were leaving the place and I could see one lady who was sitting next to the shop started following us every shops we went. Very spooky.\nShe manipulates the other vendors with her price.

Mountains are high but not hard to climb. It’s more like elevated walking paths unless you want to climb to the top then it’s challenging. However, there’s an elevator for those who do not want to climb. Really recommend going there! We were there for three hours. Entrance price is 40,000 VND for adults only, children do not pay. If you want to take the elevator up, it's another 15,000 dong.\n\nThere are a lots of steps to traverse, so those who find stone steps challenging please take your time and enjoy the parts of the area which don't require too many steps. There is a lift which takes you from ground level to the main walking level above. That ticket price is slightly more than the ticket to walk up directly. Beautiful Scenery!\n\nOn the base of the mountains there are thousands of shops which sell stones, marble souvenirs or even large statues of almost everything you can think of.\n\nIt’s worth to visit!!!",

Overpriced marble souvenirs but the short hike was worth it.",

Please know this is a mountain. There are many, many steps & the terrain is uneven. The elevator (there is a small charge for the elevator in addition to the admission) only takes you part way up the hill to a small viewing area, there are A LOT of steps after that also. If you are heat sensitive, be cautious. Most areas are small with little air flow.  The mountains are truly spectacular. There are many paths & ‘nooks & cranny’s’ to explore, however, know what you are embarking on before going. If you have the physical means to do this, I highly recommend!",

The entrance fee is 40K per person. If you don't want to walk the first part to the top, you can buy a ticket for the panoramic elevator for 15K.\n\nThe quickest and cheapest way to get to the Marble Mountains is by taxi/grab.",

I thought it was going to be a quick and boring attraction, but we ended up spending 2 hours walking around and exploring the caves and pagodas. Very impressive.\n\nBuying the tickets can be very confusing, we paid 15k, then they said we got the wrong one, we had to ask for refund, and buy it in another place. The staff don’t speak any English and wasn’t willing to help at all. Entrance ticket: 55k (elevator included).",

Beware of the vendors at the bottom of the mountain, they will be waiting. One follow us for about 200 meters after we repeatedly told her we don’t have enough space.

The beach chairs were super worth it as they only cost 40k per person. The downside is only that you’re allowed to swim only in certain areas and not everywhere. A tip is also to come early in the day as all the locals come to the beach after 16:00, so it gets really busy then but before that the beach is empty.",

Usually, people start coming here from 3 pm onwards. Although there's no sunset here, many tourists come to swim, play, sunbathe, or try the restaurants along the beach. Even in the evening, the beach is still bustling with people.\n\nMy Khe Beach is renowned for its blue skies, fine white sand, gentle slope, clear and warm water all year round, and beautiful surroundings with coconut trees. Everything around this beach is peaceful, natural, and relaxed.\n\nMy Khe Beach is an ideal and safe place for adults and children to swim anytime throughout the year. It also offers stunning sunrise views, so try to stay close to the beach to enjoy the breathtaking scenery right from your room.\n\n#Mykhebeach #Vietnam #Danang #DanangVietnam #travel",

The Cham minority group were wiped out by Vietnamese after their leader was offered the hand of a princess, then using the pretext that she was not well treated, the Vietnamese invaded the Cham Kingdom, including destroying their residences and temples. Indeed a sad tale but one which is really common across many countries.\n\nThe museum is clean and quiet, the artefacts are not all whole, some are just feet, head without body, headless, etc. Fascinating that the Cham people worshipped Shiva the destroyer. His shrine is everywhere as well as Parvathy, his wife. The strong Indian influence is evident in the sculptures.\n\nThe museum is located directly across the tail of the dragon Bridge. Heaps of restaurants and cafes along the opposite street.",

The stark contrast to the Vietnamese culture is easily recognizable with many motives and deities from the Hindu influence. In summer time, the air inside is hot during the day , thus early morning or late afternoon will be a better visit time.\n\nThe museum can improve its exhibitions significantly by providing more interactive contents, for example VR or quizzes. I tried to use the automatic audio guide but failed due to a broken link. Connecting the exhibits points with the external sites and transportation services could be a good idea. An excursus about Vietnamese folklores and superstitions about the Champ culture could be also very interesting for the foreign visitors. The museum is concentrated on the sculptures and architecture in Champs culture alone, so many questions remain unanswered: how did the Champs offer their gods? How were their daily lives? How were there trading and relationships with one cultures?\n\nBecause this museum is the only museum about the Champs culture, I feel these aspects of the Champs culture are sadly neglected.\n\nAll in all, visiting the museum brought in me the reminiscent of long lost past and the melancholy of an once vibrant culture.",

These visual reminders were created as a way for practitioners to focus on the devoted path to honor nature and the eternal way of the truth and light.\n\nPlan to spend about a solid one hour to fully flow through the museum.

There do are a lot of hm how should I describe it balls of women lol, so you can discern yourself between your children should come here or not. It doesn't have AC but got fans like 3 in the whole darn facility lol The artifacts there are very unprotected though, I'm more surprised by how the museum would give so much faith that tourists won't be clumsy and smash one of those treasures, but it's cool. At least there won't be glare in my photos haha",

Most exhibits have descriptions in Vietnamese, English and French.\nThe museum contains many pieces moved by French from My Son and other Champa sites. I’d recommend visiting here before exploring the actual sites as you can get a lot of background info and you’ll be better equipped to make sense of them by coming here first.",

Painted on the walls of its grand concourse are fascinating historic maps of South Vietnam, Saigon and Cholon, while a mosaic of Ho Chi Minh takes pride of place at the end of its barrel-vaulted hall. Note the magnificent tiled floor of the interior and the copious green-painted wrought iron.\r\n",

Built in the late 19th century, the French colonial design is incredible, with high ceilings, intricate details, and beautiful mosaic floors. Inside, you can admire the historical maps and even send a postcard from this historic site. While it can get crowded, it's a worthwhile stop to experience a piece of Vietnamese history and capture some amazing photos.",

It is a working post office, however part of it is converted to sell souvenirs, although there are many vendors selling souvenirs outside the post office. The  post office is almost 100 years old and has beautiful French colonial architecture. Across from the road is the Notre Drame Cathedral. It is another popular tourist spot with beautiful architecture . However its a pity it is undergoing renovation.",

I tried sending letters, thank God the staff on the middle for post cards and magnets is very kind and helpful because the employees for sending the letters feels like they don’t want questions.\n\nWhat I did?\nBuy post card, write letter, buy stamps and envelope and drop. Stamps cost me 23k and envelope is 3k. The post card I chose is 15k, price depends on the design.\n\nFront of it is the Notre Dame, on the side is the Book street.

In front of the post office, there are agricultural roadshow which shows the cotton decoration.\n\nInside the building, you can buy the postcard and send to your family or partner. I did that 5 years ago, so will just skip it.\n\nNext, at the entrance one your left and right, you will see 2 staircase leading up to souvenir shop. Be it t shirt, plushy, magnet, flags, and all those souvenir you see on the street.\n\nRemember that this is a fully functional post office, so enjoy your time here.  Probably 30 minutes.",

But somehow once you enter you might feel boredom to stay here for a long time.\n\nThe ticket purchasing process was smooth and at the top level you can see the view of Saigon city from a 360 degree angle. You also can zoom to some specific place with the tower scope. If you are lucky then you're gonna see a sunset view from the top of the building. As for us it is quite unfortunate not to view that due to weather season and cloud. More and more tourists start coming as the sun is beginning to set.\n\nAll in all we still enjoyed being here. There is also a booth that sells merchandise and souvenirs of the skydeck. Free wifi is also provided on the whole level. We stayed here until around 6.30pm and I think it's a fine place to visit especially for those who want to see the view from the top and the exchange from day to night.",

There are a few informational panels, a small display of traditional Vietnamese women's wear, and some photo ops.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to be for some chill observation.",

Fantastic views, can see for miles in all directions and with the sunset too it was absolutely stunning. They also have interactive maps showing the landmarks that you\'re looking at which was a nice touch. The "art exhibition" was a bit random, there were 10 or so dresses from varying time periods and regions of Vietnam. Unfortunately the bar was closed for maintenance when we went, would have loved a drink with a view. Overall fantastic experience especially for the price, would 100% go again!',

Once you are greeted, you are taken to an elevator, and they press floor 49 for you.  It takes about 35 seconds.  Very comfortable. Once you get to floor 49, the deck opens to beautiful views of the city.  There are free binoculars to view through.  I liked all the exhibits.  There is a cyclo vehicle, a map that shows the top 20 iconic observation buildings and an Ao Doa exhibit, which shows fashion from 1613 to 1990.  There is a 7-minute film on the fashion that is beautifully done.  Water is complimentary.  Every viewpoint is amazing.  The observation deck was very comfortable with good air quality.  I enjoyed sitting and just asking it all in.  Highly recommend a visit here.",

                                   "Some amazing views from this location and so easy to access were we waited a few minutes to get our tickets and then we where taken to the main lift that took us up so fast our ears popped, once in the viewing area the sights just took your breath away, you can walk 360° around to see the whole of Vietnam! Gift shops and toilets all on the same floor you only really need 15 mins up hear too to see and take pictures then the speedy lift back to the bottom! We'll worth it",

I fell in love with the music and the story itself! Highly recommend!\n\nDon’t be shy to take pictures and short videos, but out of respect for the show itself I suggest keeping it minimal and enjoying the beautiful puppetry and sight before your eyes!",

Otherwise, you won't be understanding any of it as the matter of fact the show continues in the Vietnamese language.  The show is about the Vietnamese culture and life representation using puppets. There are shows daily at 5 pm & 6.30 pm(I am not sure pm show about the 7.45 pm show) and lasts for 45 minutes each show. Front seats are better and cost more.",

A worthy experience that can easily be a \"must see\" for a 'successful' visit to Saigon (HCMC). The only negative factor was the lack of consideration on part of a guest or two who persistently raised their hands for prolonged periods of time  to click photos/take videos of the performance, hindering the view for others (example of the guests as below in the pic seated in row H on 18 Dec 22). This aspect can certainly be looked at as a policy measure.",

It lasted about 45 mins and the children (9 and 6) were mesmerized.  None of the talking we understood but this doesn't really matter, there is enough going on with the puppets and the music to keep you entertained.  It's d 300,000 each and you can buy at the box office on your way in, we didn't do this as part of a tour.",

I’m not sure if that’s because we purchased tickets at the box office 2 hours before the performance, or the fact that they saw we had our 3 year old with us. Tickets are numbered at time of purchase, so they are set seats. It was so enjoyable. You can’t help but wonder how the puppeteers do it!",

We stayed back to watch the sunset and it was one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever witnessed. The sky turned into beautiful colours 🥹 you can find many cafés near this beach so make sure you check them out. Don’t miss this beach on your trip to Hoi An. 🌷",

If you want an ice cream walk down the road about 3 minutes and you'll come to a proper ice cream shop that does waffle cones for 20k and 2 scoops of a flavour for another 20k. Much better than 30k ice cream on the beach front. Note the picture is already half eaten :) Sunbeds are available, but you are better off buying a cocktail and getting the sunbed for nothing 👍",

I reached there at 5 AM in the morning and to my surprise there were a lot of locals already taking a dip in the sea. It seemed like daily practice for them to take a bath in the rising sun and do some exercises to start the day with.\n\nIt was a very calming experience and great insight into the local living style in that region.\n\nTip: If you are taking a grab bike ride to the beach, make sure you arrange the way back as well, I was not able to find any Grab at 7:30 AM from the beach to Hoi An, and I had to take a lift.",

My experiences with SE Asian beaches did not give me a good impression of beaches outside of WA and I was reluctant to spend the morning sitting on a deck chair staring at the water. My partner however convinced me to go as she had been there before and she assured me that it’s a good beach.. and indeed it was. The water was cool, clear and refreshing and being a 35C day there was not a better place to be. The hotel pool was warm and full of people but here, you have views which are picturesque to say the least, with a huge selection of beachside bars to choose from. What I like about this beach is that it’s not polluted and teaming with motorised watercraft. It’s peaceful, tranquil and you can order a cocktail, beer or coffee to sit and catch some sun then dive into the cool water of the sea. Highly recommended to spend the morning/afternoon/evening especially if your hotel runs a shuttle bus to the beach. I believe they have happy hour and live music in the evening as well.",

                                   "Spend the day at Dolphin kitchen and bar by the beach. IReally clean facilities. It was just what the Dr order.  When we arrived we were told we get towels, beach lounge,  access to shower and toilets and free wifi if you buy a drink. We spent almost 5 hrs there . Went for a quick splash in the water, non patrol beach and surf is really rough so be careful, but  it was worth it . The water was just the right temperature.  Around lunch time more people arrived but heard  employee telling them that for  1 drink they could stay for 1 hour with all the inclusions. We were not pushed to consume more drinks or food  but we did end up having more than a couple of drinks and food to go with them . Got back to hotel feeling very relaxed. We got a grab from hotel to beach costing us just a couple of AUD each way.",

Visited on Wed-Fri.\n\nThere are very few street vendors and the restaurants can be a little pushy to passing tourists, but it's few and far between. Nothing like the centre of Hoi An.\n\nWe spent some time in the area around the Dolphin restaurant and the swimming there is great. At low to medium tide the water is chest high so not too deep. There is also a large swim area. The water seems to be calmest in the morning (almost flat when we were there). Most restaurants appear to provide free sunbeds, towels and showers when buying drinks.",

                                   "A Bang beach is a lively place to visit, you can relax on the one of the many sunbeds located on the beach in front of the palm leaf roofed restaurants that line the beach front. I’ve seen some reviews which state it’s a bit dirty with litter but I didn’t see much of this, there is going to some mess but your expectations should be ready for this. The women on the beach employed by the restaurants to get you to take a sunbed can be overwhelming…where we sat close to the middle of the restaurant front, they were continuously shouting and waving to attract passing tourists to take their sunbeds. It was too much for many people who did not appreciate being caught up in the verbal tussle of these competing Vietnamese ladies shouting between themselves as they hassle you to use their beds. From what I heard they want you to spend around VND150000 to cover the use of two beds and parasol. A few people were stopped and shown to a sunbed but when they told these ladies they only wanted a couple of beers it was made clear to them this wouldn’t cover use of the sunbed for a day. As has been said, the beach is a lot quieter away from A Bang, although I understand the ladies livelihood may depend on bringing the punters in….for me and quite a few others the constant shouting and waving and walking in between your sunbeds was frankly just too much hassle and took away the chance to relax….plenty of restaurants, the food was good and the drinks reasonably priced…the coconut coffee was delicious",

In the evening, there are makeshift restaurants set up so you can sit on a provided picnic mat if you order food and drink. I’m not sure how English-friendly this service is but definitely wish I had checked it out while I was there.\nThe views are great. You can visit during the day, there are a number of beachfront restaurants and bars with fans to cool you down in the heat.",

Think there is a guide available but I was happy to just look at the lovely carved wood details and to see just how open air the lifestyle here is (surprising for a North European!) Open courtyard in the middle of the building let's the light flood in and marks on the walls show where the water floods in as well.",

                                   "This Mausoleum it’s very interesting architecturally as it is very different from most of the other tombs around Hue and was the last one built. It was made with (at that time) new materials like cement and glass and inside the main building you can see the largest painting in all of Vietnam (according to my tourguide).\n\nIt is 20 minutes out of the city, but I don’t know where the other reviewers found the adventurous motorbike ride, every street was a street, no dirt paths. There are not many places with shade, so you should not come here in the mid day heat, you also have to climb a lot of stairs.\n\nThere are not many signs in English teaching about the history of this place so I recommend coming with a tourguide. The entry costs 150k VND, but it is cheaper when you buy the combo ticket of the tombs and the royal palace.",

More specifically the room where the tomb of Emperor Khải Định is located. It's impressive.\nI also find the ceramic walls a marvel of craftsmanship.\nThere is an interesting contrast between the outside, very black, and the inside very colourful and rich.\nA real must-see !",

The dragon carvings on the stairs are exquisite, with such careful attention to detail, and offer a wonderful view from the top when you ascend them to the tomb when you arrive. In addition to the soldiers, there are also horses and elephants guarding the tomb on either side, which is something we really liked. With the most magnificent mosaics all throughout, the tomb interior is just stunning. A truly amazing location that is well worth a trip.",

Wear sensible shoes snd for those with bad knees, be prepared to climb up steep, narrow and high steps before you reach the tomb. Also, scary walking down. I am glad I did it though.\n\nThe tomb is totally mesmerising and beautiful. Not much emotion has been included to make out whether King Khai Dinh was loved and admired during his reign. Do you spend so much effort and pour money into building a flawless tomb for a king?\n\nThe mosaic artwork, porcelain and bronze items are works of masters. I overheard one of the tour guides mention that the ceiling artwork is the original and not at all bern restored or touched up. How? After all these years!! ❤️😍😍❤️\n\nOh! The view from the top is excellent too.",

                                   "Visiting the Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh felt like stepping into a gothic fairytale! 🏰 This place is an eclectic mix of Vietnamese and European styles, with every corner showcasing intricate details and jaw-dropping craftsmanship. The blackened stone exterior gives off an edgy vibe, but once inside, you're greeted with an explosion of color and elaborate mosaics. ✨\n\nClimbing up the steep stairs to the top is totally worth it—you're rewarded with stunning views and a close-up look at the emperor's larger-than-life statue. 👑 Plus, the weathered stone and beautiful greenery around it make for a great photo shoot. If you’re into history, this spot is a must-see!\n\nBring an umbrella to protect you from the sun because it will beam on you 🌞",

                                   "Between this Mausoleum and the one for Tu Duc, we were really blown away by this one. A guide said to do this one combined with one of the other two, as this one is very unique compared to the others and we agree.   You can buy a pass for one site, three, or all four. We were glad we picked three including this one, but if you pick four you will see them all. You have two days to use the pass.\n\nYou don’t need much time here as it is smaller, but it is very impressive. The structure is up many stairs and very impressive but the true beauty is inside. The ornate ceramic murals on the walls and painted mural ceilings were some of the most beautiful pieces of Asian architecture and history we have seen. Additionally you see the view from the hill it is on with a view of the standing Buddha. We did not go see the base of the Buddha as we had a good view from here. On a somewhat stormy day it was very beautiful.\n\nThis is not a place for people who cannot go up stairs, as there are about four flights to get up. There is a free bathroom and 4K motorbike parking at the base.",

We rented a moped in Hue centre and drove up, it’s a lovely drive and would recommend doing this if you’re confident. The view from the mausoleum was very nice as well.

Als wir da waren, waren kaum Touristen vor Ort, es waren eher einheimische, die diesen Ort besucht haben. Ihr werdet am Anfang von einheimischen abgefangen, die euch dazu auffordern, auf einem Parkplatz zu parken. Diese könnt ihr guten Gewissens umfahren, denn ein paar Meter weiter könnt ihr mit dem Roller oder dem Motorrad an der Straße auf einer Art Pflastersteinen kostenlos parken.\nDer eigentliche Tempel kommt etwas weiter hinten, in diesem Bereich sind Schilder aufgestellt, diese bitte auch lesen und ihnen folgen!\nWir, als Touristen, kommen in dieses Land und besichtigen bestimmte Sehenswürdigkeiten und Tempel, da kann es wohl auch von uns verlangt werden, uns hier geltende Kleiderordnung und Regeln zu halten. Schultern sowie Knie, vor allem bei Frauen, sollten bedeckt sein. Wenn ihr ein kurzes Sommerkleid an habt, dann geht dort einfach nicht rein!! Ich sehe immer wieder Frauen, denen das anscheinend total egal ist? Verstehe ich nicht, denn das ist ein Glaube, eine Religion, der man Respekt zollen sollte. Das Schild, dass auf die Kleiderordnung hinweist, kann man nicht übersehen, da es direkt am Eingang hängt.\nMan muss jetzt nicht lesen können, einfach nur Augen im Kopf besitzen.\nBeim betreten des Tempels sind die Schuhe auszuziehen, auch das ist eine Sache des Respekt vor dem Glauben. Komplett hinein darf man nur, wenn man auch beten möchte, dennoch hat man die Möglichkeit hinein zu sehen.\nEs ist wirklich ein wunderschöner, atemberaubender und spiritueller Ort.\nHierfür gebe ich eine glatte zehn von zehn.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nThis is a beautiful temple in the middle of Hue. When we were there there were hardly any tourists there, it was mostly locals who visited this place. At the beginning you will be intercepted by locals who ask you to park in a parking lot. You can bypass these with a clear conscience, because a few meters further you can park your scooter or motorbike for free on a kind of paving stones on the street.\nThe actual temple is a little further back, there are signs in this area, please read them and follow them!\nWe, as tourists, come to this country and visit certain sights and temples, so we may also be required to adhere to the dress code and rules that apply here. Shoulders and knees, especially for women, should be covered. If you're wearing a short summer dress, just don't go in there!! I keep seeing women who don't seem to care at all? I don't understand, because this is a belief, a religion that should be respected. You can't miss the sign indicating the dress code because it's hanging right at the entrance.\nYou don't have to be able to read, you just have to have eyes in your head.\nShoes must be taken off when entering the temple, this is also a matter of respect for the faith. You are only allowed to go in completely if you want to pray, but you still have the opportunity to look inside.\nIt is truly a beautiful, breathtaking and spiritual place.\nI give this a solid ten out of ten.",

                                   'More than a walk from the central city area, but easy to access on a bike. Parking for locals around the left hand side helps avoid the "shopping" strip at the front, but strongly recommend you approach and enter from the water. A beautiful 7-tier pagoda and grounds, still actively used and peaceful even when theres a crowd. The rear of the grounds is calm and shaded; worth exploring beyond the first gate.',

Perched on the banks of the Perfume River in Hue, its iconic seven-story pagoda stands as a symbol of the city. The tranquil gardens and historical artifacts within the temple grounds provided a reflective space, inviting peace and contemplation. It's not just a site of religious significance but also a beacon of Vietnamese culture and history. A must-see for those seeking a deeper understanding of Hue's spiritual heritage.",

The best time to visit is in the evening during sunset as the orange hue of the sky shimmering on the river and the pagoda feels mystical and jubilant, with fewer crowds. Encourage you to go behind the main pagoda as there is a temple and a smaller pagoda inside that is in a more serene setting than the main one in the front. A short 1 hour stop is enough here before you go back to the hotel.",

A popular tourist and local destination, and area is not big, hence the crowd is unavoidable.\nThere are 3 parts to this historical site: the seven-tier Pagoda (front), the temple and monastery (middle), and the tombstone (innermost). While the monastery and gardens are well-kept, many of the ancient structures are run-down. Unless you have an interesting and knowledgeable tour guide, about 20 mins is all takes to tour this place.

After encountering some unforeseen problems, my stay was cut short to just 10 days. Despite the hotel's promise to refund half of the payment, which amounted to 600 euros, I never received the money and also they did not reply on messages.\n\nWhat's even more concerning is that my initial concerns about their refund policy were validated by this experience. Prior to booking, I came across reviews from other guests who had similar issues with refunds. It's disheartening to see a lack of accountability and transparency from the hotel management.\n\nI urge future guests to proceed with caution before making any reservations at this place. As for my experience, I'm deeply disappointed and regretful that I cannot recommend this based on my personal encounter.",

They have a partnership with an alternative spa but they make you pay for the transportation. When we voiced our concerns we were told there was nothing they could do. We checked out a day early because it was not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel by any means. They refused to refund us or cooperate in any capacity.",

We found it by chance online after a Ha Long Bay cruise when we had two spare nights, but by the end we didn’t want to leave! The Sunset Valley room was perfect for chilling in the day and romantic evenings, completed with a gorgeous bath and cute terrace. The staff were the nicest people we’ve met in Vietnam, all extremely local but with a massive smile on their faces and always happy to help. The whole resort is incredible, the views are breathtaking and the restaurant delighted us every single day. We took the bikes out one day and they were really easy to use. I honestly cannot recommend this place enough, it was perfect.",

All fantastic experiences and beatifully decorated with exclusive good taste. Staff is super helpful. Food and drink prices are very reasonable. The surroundings and views are breathtaking. Breakfast is excellent, but the dinner restaurant relatively boring compared to other places we stayed in Vietnam.",

And we wished we would have spent the time and the money better here than on the cruise.\n\nThe entire hotel venue is designed very beautifully down to the last detail in the rooms and in the restaurant like a stylish, luxury boutique eco lodge.\nWe had two Mountain Verendah Chamber rooms which have been simply marvelous.\nThe pool area is wonderful.\nThe entire service, all people from the reception, over the restaurant service up to the room service were super nice and courteous.\n\nThe restaurant was excellent. Offering a high variety of Vietnamese food, especially also local food from the region (you must try the goat curry or the stir-fried beef). As we were traveling with kids, it's also worth mentioning that the Spaghetti Bolognese was one if the best outside of Italy. 😉\n\nThe bar at the pool had a high variety of delicious drinks (recommendation: Mojito with Bazil!).\n\nNearby the hotel there are many activities and things to see. The hotel offers bicycles for rent.\n\nOne of the nicest and best hotels I've ever stayed!",

However, there was an unexpected charge for using the sauna, which felt a bit much.\n\nThe resort offers amenities like a spa and pools. Their bar, especially Duong the bartender, is a highlight.

Rooms were large and the pool was amazing. But the best was how friendly everyone was. Only meant to stay 2 nights. We stayed 4 night. Would give this place 10* out of 5.",

                                   "This is a truly special hotel. I’ve travelled a lot all over the world, and this is a rare find.\n\nDesign: I am a designer and travel a lot for work consulting on design projects, the attention to detail here is sublime. The craftsmanship of the timber frames is exquisite, and everything else is crafted from local natural materials. Not a single tacky or synthetic object in sight. It’s Pinterest in every direction you look.\n\nRooms: I love how the room is set in the evenings without you noticing, the lights are dimmed, the bed net drawn, and the shades drawn too. So much care, so much attention to detail - creates a beautiful sense of ease and peace.\n\nFood: The food is great, no complaints at all. It’s important to note this place isn’t flashy, it’s not like they have a famous chef or anything - and I wouldn’t want that here. The food is really good, probably the best food in the area. But just low key, and uncomplicated, you show up to meals in shorts and a t shirt and fee like you’re at home. Service is very attentive.\n\nAmenities: The spa building is probably the most gorgeous building here, the sauna is the nicest sauna I’ve ever been in. Again not fancy, but it’s the details. The water buckets has small drops of essential oil floating on top - the kumquat tea is the best tea I’ve ever had - I’m truly sad I can’t take it back to London with me - but I will try !\n\nService: The hotel will help you with anything they can, they picked me up from Hanoi and dropped me back off at the airport. This hotel really doesn’t let you lift a finger. There are free bicycles which are a great way to get around.\n\nTo be desired: Not much to be honest. A little outdoor gym would be quite nice, maybe with an outdoor shower. Could be really simple like just a pull up bar, and a flat space to do some yoga and stretching, there is yoga at the hotel at 7am, too early for me haha! If the hotel had a loyalty program - like 30% off your next stay - I would send my parents out here in a heartbeat.\n\nConclusion: Believe all the hype, this hotel is well regarded and has an international reputation as one of the best boutique hotels in Vietnam. Now I understand why.",

                                   "One of the most perfect hotels in one of the most beautiful locations!\n\nMy friend and I had an incredible two night stay. The property is unbelievably gorgeous - they clearly put in a lot of attention and care to all of the plantings and the place feels almost magical. We stayed in one of the garden bungalows - the room was very spacious for two people and while it was too hot to enjoy the private patio, we loved the rest of the room details and were particularly fond of the aesthetics of the bathroom.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed breakfast both mornings and dinner both nights - the food is of high quality and there was a good variety of options. All of the staff we interacted with were very kind and helped us arrange car service both mornings to Trang An and Mua Cave.\n\nOne thing to note is this property is a bit far from the center of Tam Coc (about 5km) - it is an easy bike ride which we enjoyed one afternoon but there are no lights on the road so you need to use a motorbike or car service once it gets dark (or if it feels too hot to bike!). We were more than happy to enjoy our evenings in the pool and dinner at the restaurant on the property so this was not a deterrent for us, but something to keep in mind if you are looking to spend more time in Tam Coc itself.\n\nThe highlight for us was definitely the pool, which has the most incredible view. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel, and hope we get to come back in the future!",

Staff speaks English and some French and is professional and well trained.\nThis hotel is extremely well managed and organized. We never lacked anything.\nYou can message staff on Whatsapp for anything (ordering something, airport transfer, booking massage…) and they will reply straight away.\nThe hotel is very elegant and beautifully designed without being pretentious, and fits well within the Vietnamese countryside landscape. It is located in one of the most peaceful areas of Tam Coc in the middle of the rice fields. You can walk around the rice fields, very peaceful. Every room has a beautiful view of the rice fields.\nIf you want to go out at night to the restaurants/bars of Tam Coc, they will order a taxi for you and the drive takes between 5 and 10 minutes.\nThe food is another highlight. Breakfast was fantastic, with Asian and Western options.\nDinner was phenomenal and beautifully presented. They also have room service.\nMassage was one of the bests I ever got!",

                                   "A stay of two halves. The second half was so good that it’s still an easy five stars and they comped us two massages and were apologetic for the first half.\n\nCut to the second part if you’re not staying in Maison Que - basically don’t stay at Maison Que if you want service and go for the hotel.\n\n1. First night was spent in their House - Maison Que - a short sampan punt over the paddy fields, 10 mins bike or 5 mins car. Fun but precarious!!\nThe house - Maison Que and the private infinity pool are beautiful. Quite quite beautiful and idyllic. Bathrooms downstairs that can be a nuisance but beautiful. The house and bedrooms all gorgeous.\nThe problem was the service - they advertise delivery from the main hotel and agreed to it in an email before we arrived. On arrival we were then told that they couldn’t do it - it was a hot pot and we can cook ourselves. Really hassly with me trying to get them to do it and them just saying no no no. Two hours later they agreed to deliver it and it was terrific and Romantic with just the two of us. But why the hassle. A really sour arrival.\n\nSaffron our travel agent organised for breakfast to be delivered but their texts started to come at 6.45 to come to the restaurant as it was raining. They point blank refused.\nThey then sent the open sampan to get us - so their view was it was fine for their guests to get wet but not the food! They told us they’d sent umbrella but that was just silly. It was so wet we would’ve been soaked.\nAnyway - 30 mins after we asked we had a car. Breakfast buffet delicious and lovely.\n\nThe inference I drew, although they advertise services to Maison Que and charge a fortune for the Maison, that they aren’t set up to deliver as they say that they would. It wouldn’t have taken anytime to deliver fruit and pho.\nDon’t stay here unless maybe you get the chef option.\n\n2. Hotel. We had a standard room for the next two nights. Wish we could have binned Maison Que and stayed here -Room no7. Maybe avoid 1&2 as close to entrance and 16/7 close to pool.\nThe hotel is one of the most beautiful and gorgeous places I have ever stayed at. It’s built like a local village. Rooms overlook paddy fields, with a balcony to the side of in front - lovely big windows and Doors overlook -  gorgeous bathrooms and sitting area. Just one of the nicest rooms.\nThey spray with citronella every day. Good for mosquitoes. Very strong however. You can ask them not to spray and that addressed it.\n\nHotel breakfasts are great with pho or selection of western eggs and a huge buffet - fruit, bread, pastries coffee and tea. Restaurant manager Phuon is a good man and looked after us.\nDinner - We enjoyed the papaya salad and goat curry - the grilled duck was finally a bit western. Fresh spring rolls are lovely. We loved the hot pot.\n\nAlso had a neck and shoulder massage. Really good but be careful asking for the firm!! She is strong.\n\nMy advice is that you MUST stay here at the hotel.\nIt is gorgeous. Simply one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. Do not miss that bit. It’s a 7 star stay.\n\nHowever, Don’t stay in Maison Que unless you are cool making your way to the hotel for food.",

Or.\n\nExplore the nature by hiking from the base of mountain all the way to the peak.\n\nTo go there. Just take a quick transpiration ride from the  downtown Sapa city  to go to Sunworld park to buy the tickets.\n\nSince this is one of the highest mountain in the region.

PREFERABLY GO weekdays and even if the weather says clear skies, on top there might still have fogs. Don’t be discouraged and wait for the fog to dissipate. Stay there at least 1-2 hours (not counting the cable car). A lot of stairs. Be prepared for up and down a lot. DO take a lot of rests if you’re not fit. Stairs are also super steep! Go with a guide or group if you need help. Plenty of bathroom and vendors for drinks. Wear warm clothing too. And have fun most of all! Hope you’ll love it as i did!",

Lucky because it’s a clear day in Sapa in autumn!\n\nWe pay our money at the failed shopping mall that is the station and head down to the funicular.\n\nTickets are 800,000 dong pp midweek or 850,000 on weekends. Extra 150,000 for the lower funicular and 150,000 for the upper funicular.\n\nWe chose the lower and the cable car figuring we’d climb the last bit. And we did. Lots of stairs but it was fun stopping along the way for many, many photos.\n\nThe cable car journey is spectacular and long - just over 6k.\n\nThe temples and associated statues are amazing, but nature is the star here. The views across the valley toSapa are stunning, as are the views that seem to stretch to China.\n\nWe didn’t succumb to the food court or souvenir shopping at all the different stations so can’t comment on them.  There is a lot of ‘please exit through the gift shop’.\n\nWas a remarkable day. Do it!\n\nSmall note - wear sensible shoes. Saw lots of women struggling with heels on the narrow steps.",

Going through mountains, valley and streams. It’s absolutely worth of the ride just for that. The entire walk up is marble paved stairs. I can imagine how slippery it would be. The Buddhist temples and statues through out.  The Buddhist singing all the way to top. It’s a very different experience of hiking. Summit at 3126m. The clear day would be amazing. Foggy day should be think twice.",

I was not of fan of the latter.\n\nAll in all though it was very professionally run. The cable car to the top was enjoyable although being April, visibility was low.\n\nAside from also being on a mountain peak, it felt like a very different experience to Ba Na. We did not use the Funicular mid way but chose to take the steps to the top. It was not a difficult climb with various points of interest to stop along the way.  That said the Temples, Pagodas, statues etc… all recently constructed, did set the almost ‘theme park’ scene as they were clearly made for tourism purposes.\n\nSo I guess the bottom line is these are theme parks really, tourist driven… the trade off being access to one at one of the highest peaks in the area.  Enjoyable if you take it for what it is.",

My visit was marked by rainy, foggy, and cold weather, which added a mystical atmosphere to the experience. Despite the challenging conditions, the journey was unforgettable.\n\nThe cable car ride, an engineering marvel, is one of a kind. As it ascends through the clouds, you’re treated to stunning views of the lush valleys and towering peaks below, even with the fog partially obscuring the landscape. The ride itself is smooth and comfortable, offering a unique perspective of the region’s natural beauty.\n\nReaching the summit, the sense of accomplishment is immense, and the panoramic views, when the clouds momentarily parted, were awe-inspiring. The weather made the experience even more special, as it felt like I was stepping into a different world, high above the everyday hustle.\n\nOverall, Fansipan is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Vietnam. The combination of the thrilling cable car ride and the dramatic, ever-changing weather made this adventure both challenging and deeply rewarding.",

The amount of incredible views that you’re gonna witness on the way up is unreal. Anyone can do this hike, just go early in the morning and take your time. But you can hike it up in just over three hours and the descent takes less than three hours. If you love nature and you are in Vietnam, hiking up Mount Fansipan is a must-do. 🇻🇳",

We went up even when it was misty but still felt that it was worth it. We took the furnicular (train), then the cable car and then walked up to the top. There is also an option to take the train to the top but it is possible to walk up (heads up that it is not an easy climb with all the stairs). Cannot see much but we enjoyed the usual state of fansipan and explored the temples and statues.",

His words might not help much but his attitude and point of view will empower you and make you stronger.",

Locals just leaves their plastic containers on the beach after they eat, businesses aren’t doing much, as the littering is just increasing every day. I would never come back to a place like this, not until the government is putting an end to this, island people cannot live like this.

(Pop up food stalls, you'll easily recognize them with carts and glass storage and food diplay).\n\nTheir oceans are also surrounded with rubbish and there really isnt so much sand :( , unlike the Philippines.\n\nI stayed in a 5 star hotel M Hotel (is amazing and is a sustainability ally!) and the service was great but also explored local eateries (low-end food cafeterias), food is great wherever you go.\n\nSome people are friendly, and they really cant speak english.  I experienced incorrect orders given to me (which are happy accidents because the food turned out great anyways), because I asked about certain food so if you want something, just point it out 😁\n\nThere are no heavy traffic at all, weather is really hot in Mid-March, but yeah, it's cheaper here. Not always, but many times, you'll encounter sellers overcharging you ;)\n\nPhu Quoc, like Saigon, is also colorful but less busier on the streets.\n\nGrab bike and car are also available here which makes traveling easier, but not as many like in HCM City.\n\n#disappointed #stink",

The buses took you to most of the attractions, and if you fancied eating out in a different island location, you hoped on a free bus it was great!\nDefinitely go to Phu Quoc. we stayed in Phu Quoc Town, its busy, but you get used to it.

Located 45 kilometres west of Ha Tien in the far south of Vietnam, the northern part of the island is relatively untouched due to its status as a UNESCO-listed national park but there are plenty of luxurious resorts, funky bars, and quaint cafes along the southern coastline. Aside from beachside activities, visitors can also explore traditional villages, expansive nature parks and Buddhist pagodas, all of which are easily accessible via motorcycle, taxi, bus or even day trips by reputable companies. Catering to just about any budget level and preference, Phu Quoc’s dining scene ranges from local markets selling fresh seafood and Vietnamese street food to expat-owned bistros offering authentic western and European fare.\n\nThe best attractions in Phu Quoc prove that there are plenty of things to do during your tropical vacation besides relaxing on its pristine beaches. Situated 45 kilometres west of Ha Tien, Phu Quoc Island is home to unique Cao Dai and Buddhist temples, vibrant markets, traditional fishing villages, and pepper plantations – perfect for travellers looking to experience the local lifestyle. Despite the growing number of tourist accommodations and modern facilities along its expansive coastline, more than half of this tropical island is still a UNESCO-listed national park, where you can enjoy a full day of spotting rare wildlife species, hiking, camping, photography and bird-watching. Read on for our list of the most popular things to do on Phu Quoc Island.\n\nPhu Quoc National Park comprises more than half of Phu Quoc Island’s northern region, where adventurous travellers can enjoy a range of outdoor pursuits throughout their tropical vacation. Declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2010, this massive natural attraction spans over 314, 000 square metres of unique flora and fauna, evergreen forests, and dense mountain ranges. While the majority of Phu Quoc National Park is strictly protected by the Vietnamese government for research purposes, visitors can make their way to the Khu Rung Nguyen Sinh Forest Reserve via Ganh Dau Village as it’s accessible for camping, hiking, bird-watching, and photography. Nature lovers can also spot rare wildlife such as long-tailed macaques, silver langurs, slow lories, otters, and hornbills.\n\nIf you’re looking to test out your endurance, Mount Heaven in Phu Quoc National Park is accessible within a challenging four-hour trek through the evergreen forest followed by a 10-metre-tall bamboo ladder. The highest peak in the national park is Mount Chua, which stands 600 metres above sea level, but hiking trails and viewing platforms for the mountain are currently under construction.   Located 26 kilometres north of Duong Dong, the best way to get to Phu Quoc National Park is by booking a day tour or renting a motorcycle. The roads leading towards Ganh Dau Village can be rather bumpy, so only opt for the latter if you’re comfortable navigating through dirt roads.",

                                   "A Heavenly Escape to Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam\n\nPhu Quoc Island in Vietnam is a hidden gem that truly exceeded all my expectations. From its pristine beaches to its lush greenery and vibrant culture, this tropical paradise provided an unforgettable travel experience.\n\nFirstly, the island's natural beauty is awe-inspiring. The crystal-clear turquoise waters, coupled with powdery white sands, create a picturesque setting that rivals any postcard image. Spending lazy afternoons lounging on the beach, swimming in the warm ocean, and watching breathtaking sunsets became my daily routine. The island is also home to several secluded beaches, allowing for peaceful and intimate moments away from the crowds.\n\nThe island's diverse ecosystem is another highlight. Phu Quoc National Park offers numerous hiking trails through dense forests, leading to hidden waterfalls and stunning viewpoints. Exploring the park was a refreshing escape from the beach, and it gave me the opportunity to witness the island's rich wildlife up close.\n\nPhu Quoc is also renowned for its vibrant night markets, where one can experience the island's local culture and indulge in its mouthwatering cuisine. The Dinh Cau Night Market is a must-visit, offering an array of fresh seafood, local delicacies, and unique souvenirs. Trying the famous \"Phu Quoc fish sauce\" is a must, as it is a testament to the island's culinary heritage.\n\nMoreover, the island's friendly and welcoming locals enhanced my overall experience. Their warm hospitality and eagerness to share their traditions and stories made me feel like a part of their community. Engaging with them allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the island's history and cultural significance.\n\nWhile there are numerous accommodations available, I highly recommend staying in one of the beachfront resorts. The luxurious amenities, coupled with breathtaking ocean views, create an atmosphere of pure relaxation and tranquility.\n\nIn terms of accessibility, Phu Quoc Island is easily reachable by air, with regular flights from major cities in Vietnam. Once on the island, renting a motorbike is a popular and convenient option for exploring its various attractions.\n\nIn conclusion, my trip to Phu Quoc Island was an unforgettable experience. Its natural beauty, vibrant culture, and warm locals made it a destination that I would highly recommend to any traveler seeking a tropical escape. Whether you're looking for relaxation or adventure, Phu Quoc Island has it all.",

There are a lot of photos covering off the clash between the French and the Vietnamese people and the challenges that laid ahead for them. I found it quite interesting. Quite a bit to see.",

                                   "Interesting, but with a skosh of unnecessary touch...\n\nTo begin with, this museum is another exciting museum in the city, but this time with some additional ( and artificial ) objects/articles, which generally are not meant to be in such kinds of museums.\n\nThe Museum has three floors. At the base, there are a plethora of wares. When I went here, there was an exhibition going on the second floor which was conducted in collaboration with another country's relevant authorities. About 2/5th of the boards ( on this floor ) were only in the local language. It was knowledgeable to know about the struggle, freedom movement, and action plans of the leaders back then i.a., and there is information available about plans, their implementation and after-effects during the early and mid-70s. There are also various quotes shown with the names of the leaders ( incl. photos in some cases ), and information about conferences, key strategic decisions and landmark movements/achievements i.a. There is also a succulent mention of the present global relations of the country.\n\nThe second and largest floor of the museum has a lot. Due to the time constraint courtesy to their lunch break time, I couldn't get to see even half the museum properly, but based on what I saw, it was again very interesting. There is a collection of objects used during the War times ( like various types of arrows, and prisoner uniforms ), personal items used by popular personalities, some historical paintings, stuff about the life of the founder ( incl a statue ), i.a.\n\nAnd now the superfluous elements.  The most surprising thing was the presence of some totally unconnected/unrelated items like fake fruits, metal flowers and leaves, and fake masks, i.a. Surely they look more better when they are seen in other shops, but definitely not inside the historical sites like a museum. I am not sure why the organisers saw it worthwhile to have them here, and the same space would have been used for other apposite boards/articles.\n\nThe entry ticket is VND 40,000, and like its counterparts, this museum too is closed for the lunch break and on Mon and Fri. There is also a cafeteria on the premises at the base near the exit. As for other museums in Hanoi, it would be in the good interest of the visitors if this lunch closing time is done away with. Surely, staff can go for lunch, but visitors should be allowed to continue to explore the museum. In the absence of the same, it becomes difficult for people who love history and museums to see the whole site in one visit given the timings.",

After he passed away on September 2nd 1969, in compliance with the Vietnamese people’s aspiration, the Communist Party of Vietnam’s Politburo decided to build the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and the Ho Chi Minh Museum. After 20 years of preparing and building, the Ho Chi Minh Museum was inaugurated on September 2nd 1990, on the occasion of the 100th birthday of the President. Ho Chi Minh Museum has more than 170,000 decuments, objects and films about President Ho Chi Minh’s life and revolutionary work. They are invaluable assets of the Vietnamese people in educating patriotism, studying and following Ho Chi Minh’s thought and moral quallties; and encouraging the Vietnamese generations to succeed failthfully and excellently his great revolutionary work. Entry ticket price is cheap. It’s very long queues on public holidays. Food stalls are available for refreshments. Recommended.",

During my visit, I noticed a significant presence of students exploring the museum, eager to learn about the profound influence of Ho Chi Minh on both a national and global scale. The exhibitions showcased his interactions with world leaders, contributions from individuals across the globe, and his relentless efforts in securing Vietnam's independence.\n\nWhile the museum undoubtedly provides a patriotic experience, I couldn't help but notice a certain bias in its presentation.

                                   "Really disappointing. I can easily spend 2-5 hours in a museum but wasn't even here for one whole hour. They also don't take student discounts, this was the only museum out of the many I went to in Hanoi that didn't.\n\nThe building is incredible, and the displays look cool, but the information isn't well organized or clear. There are so many fascinating items, but it is so hard to go through the exhibit and get a clear picture.\n\nI know very little about this history and came hoping to learn more, but I didn't. The National Museum was better for learning but very stale compared to the aesthetic quality of this museum.",

                                   "The museum was a worthwhile watch for the history lovers. But I had a bad experience there regarding the submission of our belongings there. They didn't allow me to take my camera inside (but after I went in all the others were taking their cameras inside). I have submitted my camera at the baggage collection counter. After I came back to the counter it was closed and they asked me to go to the other end of the premise to collect it. I went all over the premise asking for my camera . But they made me roam here and there. I walked for above 3 km searching for my cameras. At last I came back to the entrance and requested the officers to get my camera back. One Lady officer came with us and asked the security officer to bring it to us. (Don't remember her name, but I thank her for helping me) Then the security officer went to the other end and took my camera and other belongings to me. I was really worried because I have to leave soon and catch my flight.  That was a really bad experience. They should have kept the belongings where it was collected. Otherwise the tourists will be confused.",

                                   "A Historic Glimpse\nBach Ma Temple is a fascinating piece of Hanoi's history. As one of the city’s oldest temples, it's definitely worth a visit for any history buff or curious traveler. While its historical significance is undeniable, don't expect a grand, sprawling complex. It's a smaller temple, but its charm lies in its simplicity and the rich stories it holds.\nConveniently located amidst other historical sites, Bach Ma Temple is a quick and free stop on your Hanoi itinerary. It offers a peaceful respite from the bustling city and a chance to connect with the city’s past.\n* Overall: ★★★\n* Historical Significance: ★★★★\n* Atmosphere: ★★★\n* Value: ★★★★★",

Stuff you can browse through while also having some hearty meals and juices you can spend an entire day here and buy everything or nothing. The options spoil you for choice.\n\nMost ladies run the shops and they are smart as a whip. They will bargain with you and yet make you feel happy about the sale. We got some very good bargains. We did meet the one odd shop keeper who was offended when we did not buy from her but overall the people were really nice & helpful.\n\nThe local guides will tell you about bargain steals at the night market. It's hogwash. You get equally good deals in the morning and more options. Spend the evenings enjoying the local vibe at a pub or eatery.",

It has four main entrances so it is easy to enter from any side.\n\nMy impression of this market is sellers are aggressively selling their products. As I didn’t intend to buy souvenirs from here, so I don’t dare to stop by. I just take a glance while passing by.\n\nHygiene of the food in this market I am not too sure since didn’t try it out. But I notice a street nearby has an unpleasant smell like garbage. Road surface has liquid like water coming out from garbage that make the street smelly. Not only that, I saw a worker thrown the one-time-use utensils to roadside in front of their restaurant after customer leave. This is somewhere nearby the market but not inside the market. Perhaps hygiene awareness can be improve further.",

Many booths have the same things.  The next booth, try 65% off.  Keep going and trying again and again, eventually you will find their bottom price and get the best possible deal.",

                                   "Ben Thanh Market, located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, is a bustling hub of activity and a must-visit destination for anyone looking to experience the vibrancy of Vietnamese culture. This iconic market is a treasure trove of goods, offering everything from clothing, shoes, and sandals to souvenirs, dry fruits, fresh produce, honey, and essential oils. The sheer variety of items available makes it a one-stop shop for tourists and locals alike.\n\nThe market is designed with multiple entrances, making it easy to access from different parts of the city. Once inside, you’ll find a maze of small shops tightly packed next to each other, creating a lively and dynamic atmosphere. While the main walkways can get crowded, there is generally enough space to navigate through the smaller alleys between the shops.\n\nOne of the key aspects of shopping at Ben Thanh Market is bargaining. Prices here are typically quoted at a much higher rate than the actual value, as the market is well-known for its bargaining culture. It’s not uncommon for vendors to start with prices that are almost double what you might eventually pay. Therefore, honing your bargaining skills before visiting is essential. The key to getting a good deal is to compare prices at several shops before making a purchase. This way, you can get a sense of the market rate for the items you’re interested in and use that knowledge to negotiate a better price.\n\nA few tips for shopping at Ben Thanh Market:\n- Don’t rush to buy from the first shop you visit.\n- Take your time to explore multiple shops and compare prices.\n- Be prepared to walk away if the vendor doesn’t agree to your offer – often, they will call you back with a lower price.\n\nDespite the sometimes overwhelming bargaining process, Ben Thanh Market is a fantastic place to roam around and soak in the local culture. The market is open until 9 PM every day, giving you plenty of time to explore and shop at your leisure. Whether you're looking to buy souvenirs for friends and family or simply enjoy the vibrant atmosphere, Ben Thanh Market offers a truly authentic Vietnamese shopping experience.",

You can bargain for souvenirs for a better price but I feel you can't get the best discount when doing solo. Furthermore, it seems every stall has the same connections whereby they will introduce other vendors to offer deals. I managed to get multiple fridge magnets and coffee. The place is a bit confusing at first but it is better to get lost so you can explore more. The establishment also serves food and drinks too but they missed my order after I waited for 30 minutes so I left. A bit disappointed but it is an opener for me.",

It’s definitely more of the same with the vendors trying their best to entice you to buy anything.\nThe market is also quite well organized with the walkways quite wide and very easy to navigate.\nThe fresh produce section on the one side is definitely not for the squeamish. Avoid if you are so inclined. The market is under roof but no AC only a few fans doing their best.\n\nIt’s worth a trip, not really cheap.

                                   "\"A scammed place, a tourist trap?\"\n\nYou can define it yourself. Been here twice and I have a lot of experiences and mixed feelings about this market. This place has a lot of items that you can find especially if you are a tourist that is looking for souvenirs, coffee beans, and apparel. The seller here is quite aggressive in pushing you to buy at their shop but you must be more aggressive and smart to deny it. Just simply shut up, reject firmly or walk away. Avoid asking the price if you just want to know as they might push you to buy. Just let them offer the price first and if you don't like just walk away and don't bargain for more.\n\nIt happened to me bumping into this one shop owned by this sweet young lady that can speak Malay that offers me a cheaper price compared to other shops only on the first time asking without forcing me to buy from her shop. She gave me the best price and also provided me with good service and was not annoyed entertain our behaviour. For those who want to come I totally recommend you to find this lady shop to buy jersey, short, and shirt. Also don't forget to quote your best price so you can meet in the middle ground.\n\nFor those who don't want to bargain and tired of negotiating there are also a section where all the items are fixed price so you don't need to argue with the seller. Just buy it if you like and leave if you don't. I hope for those who want to visit to make a good decision in purchasing items because of interest not because of being force.",

It has adequate space inside and vendors are likely to call on you to buy at their shops if you're easily recognised as a foreigner.\n\nGeneral advice is don't haggle unless you really insist on buying, otherwise you may get some snark remarks from the local vendors for wasting their time.",

The prices can be dropped to 80%-90% literally. (I bought a product which was quoted 350,000 dong and bought it at 50,000 dong)\n2. Do try the products from many shops before buying from one shop.\n3. The shop keepers are a bit rude. I found a few shopkeepers probably abusing a few white guys in their local language and laughing by pointing fingers to them.\n4. Best way to bargain is to let the shop keeper give you the better price.\n5. Incase some shopkeeper is rude to you, you can fill out the feedback form available at every exit gate of the market.",

However, haggling is a common practice, so be prepared for that. Personally, I visited the market more for the experience than for shopping. In the middle of the market, you'll find several old stalls where you can grab a quick meal. While the environment might not be the cleanest or coolest, it offers an authentic local experience. If you enjoy immersing yourself in local culture, I highly recommend it. The food is very cheap and quite tasty.",

                                   "While visiting Ho Chi Minh City,  I think every tourist visits the Ben Thanh Market.\nIt certainly offers an array of food,  drinks, shopping ranging from tailor made items, to shoes  bags  hats, materials, souvenirs and much more. I must admit my experience inside the market wasn't 5 star. We did purchase some Hermes scarves from a lovely and genuine couples stall. We also found some salt coffee my husband was after. We purchased some souvenirs from one stall owner who seemed quite happy to help find us the colours we were after, and gave us a reasonable price on a bunch of items. My daughter wanted to try some sandals on, and we found a stall we might try. We began looking and immediately the shop owner ( I suppose) was in ypur face and ready to make a sale. When I ask her for a price she said 2 million dong,  for fake birkenstocks. I told my hubby, as we do, when discussing purchases, and he said ok, let's think about it. Straight away, the lady dropped price to 1.8 m , as it was for my daughter. Hubby said, that's ok, we will just discuss it first, so 1.8 m dong equats to roughly $100 au . She didn't seem to like the fact we hadn't made a purchase, and continued to drop the price down to 1.6, then 1.2m dong. By this stage, we said, thank you but we think about it. She followed my husband as he walked away and got quite angry, vigorously and repeatedly tapping/shoving at his arm, saying ypu can't try my shoes on in my shop and not buy them. I was following my hubby away from the stall along with both my teens in tow,  she began getting angry at me too. I continued to walk away ignoring her.\nObviously,  no purchase was made. I certainly understand about how the vietnamese people need and want sales, but they should never treat people like that. No one will buy from you when you behave like that, certainly in Australia you can get fined or charged for aggressive behaviour and physical contact.  Not a good way to make a sale.\nThe stalls on the outside of the Ben thanh market are much more attractive to buy from, genuine lady's, care about their customer and giving you hood deal when purchasing multiple items.",

If you’re in Saigon, this is something you shouldn’t skip.\nSome of the shop owners are a bit too aggressive if you make eye contact with merchandise for a little too long so beware otherwise no one accosts you to buy stuff and if you politely decline, you’re good.\nThe hygiene level was great, the food served was delectable and we had a pleasant time sampling Vietnamese cuisine and shopping of course. One can even buy branded clothes were dirt cheap prices. Also consider bargaining as the prices are never final in places like this.",

They sell here replicas and look alike of most brands across all products which also include watches, leather bags, lady bags and purses, t shirts, artefacts, souvenirs, fruits, dry fruits  etc\n\nThere are also a few garment shops with fixed pricing. My advice is to shops which have fixed prices so that you get the best and not taken for a ride and you end up paying the right prices as the currency there still confuses me. I had a few US dollars and would pay by US dollars for simpler understanding and all shops accept USD here in 🇻🇳\n\nOver all a good looking building that houses the market, reasonable prices but bargaining needed, fixed prices shops advised.\n\nOverall a lovely place for everything and anything !\n\nPlease visit !\n\nStay safe, be careful while riding bikes and crossing roads to have a memorable trip !\n\nKeep 🇻🇳 clean and plastic free.",

The market are divided into different sections, though not clearly demarcated. There are the perishable sections which sells local fruits, vegetables, seafood and local delicacies and a section which sells prayer items and kitchen wares which serves mainly the locals.  The dry section  sells dried foods like dried fruits, preserved seafood, coffee, clothes,  imitation branded T-shirts and bags and various souvenirs which caters mainly to the tourists. Most of the stalls which cater to the tourists sell similar items. The vendors are busy attempting to promote their staffs to the tourists. There is also a section selling local foods, so if one don't mind the heat and the less hygenic conditions , it may be a good place to try out the local food. As the market is quite huge , to avoid getting lost it is advisable to remember the gate number where one entered the market.",

However it is hard to walk through as you are constantly accosted to buy things, when you say ‘No thank you’ the market sellers can on occasion be impolite. They charge tourist prices so be prepared to haggle. My advice is don’t buy from the first stall you see selling what you would like. Try a few to get the best price.\n\nIt is very crowded and can get quite hot inside. I wouldn’t recommend going on a hot day.\n\nIf your looking for a market with western sizes, and less pestering I would recommend the Russian Market. I found that one very good!",

The whole street has beer bars and you sit outside on small stools and chairs and grab beers and snacks. Lot of noise. Beers of different brands are available and flavours. We tried the Hanoi premier brand and it was light and good. Got one bottle for 35000 vnd. It’s buzzing and lively. Had cheese sticks.  they give minimum 4 cheese sticks and one is for 10000 vnd but real good and fresh with loads of cheese pull. You get a beer for even 10000 vnd. Tried fried corns too. These were good. Everyone will try to pull you to their outlet. No force though. You can sit and enjoy wherever you like. They also give you boiled peanuts. We thought these were complimentary but they charged us 20000 vnd later in the bill.\nIt’s damn crowded so be careful with yourself and your belongings",

It was a bit of a cultural shock at first but we quickly got used to it. The streets are packed with tourists and locals, all enjoying street food and beer (which is pretty cheap). We chose a place, were sat down and enjoyed the beer in the hectic enviroment, which was quite fun.\nThen the rain came. In about 5min it went from a few drops of rain to a full on shower, but the street vendors were prepared and set up umbrellas and immediately started giving out or selling rain coats. We were partially wet.. but who cares? Just enjoy the moment and have fun.. (doesn't hurt to be prepared with an umbrella or raincoat).",

Recommend starting with a drink at one of the tiny plastic tables + chairs outside and just watching the madness on the street for a bit. Around midnight, the action moves indoors (and if you’re seated outside drinking, you might be asked to quickly move inside for a moment if a police car passes by). At that point, you can easily start bar-hopping and checking out multiple different places to find one with a good vibe.",

You can walk around and be lost in the alleys for hours; looking at ques in front of the local pho shops, sitting next to the busy streets having egg coffee or stopping a vendor to taste the rice donuts (don't as yet know what are they called). The transformation from the afternoon to the evening is simply dazzling. The brilliant architecture of few buildings comes to life with lights. The lakeside transforms itself from a hazy, humid, hot afternoon to a cool place just to sit around (must try the ice-cream here).",

It’s a bustling, chaotic, and electrifying experience that you won’t want to miss if you’re in the city. Picture this: narrow streets packed with tiny plastic stools, locals and tourists mingling, and an infectious energy that fills the air.\n\nWhether you’re enjoying a cold beer at one of the street-side tables, watching the world go by, or hopping from bar to bar, this street offers an experience like no other. Live music often breaks out spontaneously, and the vibrant atmosphere draws you in, making you feel like part of the community, even if just for a night.\n\nAs the night progresses, you might have to move inside if the police drive by, but that’s just part of the quirky charm. The street is packed with bars and food vendors offering everything from grilled skewers to steaming bowls of pho. It can be a bit overwhelming with so many options, but that’s part of the adventure. If you’re unsure, just go with the flow and pick the place that calls to you.\n\nAlthough it’s a bit tourist-heavy, Ta Hien Beer Street is a magical place where cultures collide, and every visit promises unforgettable memories. Grab a Bia Hoi, sit back, and let the night unfold in this vibrant corner of Hanoi.",

                                   "Alright, picture this: It’s a sultry evening in Hanoi’s Old Quarter. I’m wandering through these narrow, bustling streets when I stumble upon this area. Now, if you haven’t heard of it, think of it as the Cheers bar of Hanoi – where everybody knows your name, or at least they will after a few beers.\n\nSo I turn the corner, and BAM! The place is alive! Tiny plastic stools everywhere, filled with people from all walks of life, all united by the universal language of cheap, cold beer. The vibe is electric – it’s like Oktoberfest decided to take a vacation in Vietnam and never left.\n\nI manage to squeeze onto a stool at a communal table, rubbing elbows with some locals and tourists who look like they’ve been here since last Tuesday. We start chatting – well, more like shouting over the symphony of clinking glasses, laughter, and sizzling street food. And let me tell you, the street vendors are like ninjas with snacks, slipping through the crowd with skewers of grilled meat and baskets of spring rolls. I sample a bit of everything, and it’s all phenomenal.\n\nSuddenly, a local guy with a guitar starts strumming some tunes. He’s like the Vietnamese John Mayer, minus the heartbreak. The whole street joins in, turning into this impromptu concert under the stars. I’m singing along with people I met five minutes ago, and it feels like we’ve known each other forever.\n\nAs the night goes on, I realize Ta Hien Beer Street isn’t just a place to drink. It’s this magical, chaotic, beautiful mess where cultures collide, friendships are forged, and every sip of Bia Hoi comes with a side of unforgettable memories. It’s where the spirit of Hanoi really shines – vibrant, welcoming, and absolutely unforgettable.\n\nSo, next time you’re in Hanoi’s Old Quarter, do yourself a favor. Head to Ta Hien Beer Street, grab a stool, order a Bia Hoi, and just let the night take you wherever it wants. Trust me, you’re in for one heck of an adventure.",

The food portion gets over around 11 pm and all close by 12. The beer part starts getting lively after midnight and goes on till 4 am. There was one place which has a balcony where you can sit and watch the ongoings on the street. Nice place for ppl like me. We also went to a bar and dance place. Unfortunately we had to come out after a drink, without having danced at all because the place was filled with hookers and gigolos. I saw some weed being sold discreetly too.",

The main attractions were all very crowded. The bay is beautiful and lush. Some people on my boat took an extra night on an island, this may be preferable for some. There’s a couple of caves to visit and some nice viewing points. Most of the tours also include a visit to the pearl farm where you can kayak. There will also be a number of activities on your boat to keep you entertained.",

And I've had a lot.\n\nThe level of customer service/approachability of the team was magnificent. I would say one of the best I've experienced.\n\nThe room was clean, good size, quiet (mostly). The housekeeping staff were great also.\n\nLocation right in the heart of town yet far enough to not be positioned right in the chaotic hustle and bustle of Hanoi.\n\nIf I could have one criticism, I would say the breakfast wasn't as comprehensive as it could have been. However, it wasn't terrible (still 4/5)\n\nIf I visit Hanoi again, I will stay here!",

Sofitel Metropole is located in the French quarter of Hanoi only a few minutes walk to beautiful Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the bustling old quarter. Going on leisurely walks nearby the hotel is lovely and relaxing. The rooms were phenomenal, very comfortable and constant room service to keep things clean. They also keep a fresh rose in the room everyday and a macaron every night! The breakfast, lunch and dinner options at the restaurant by the pool was very good too and they offered us complimentary welcome drinks twice. All the hotel staff were incredibly friendly and the service was excellent. It was in fact the most satisfying hotel experience I have had. I hope to stay again at Sofitel Hanoi and could not recommend it more.",

The breakfast was fantastic. The rooms were very elegant but quite tight. We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms and the closet door would not even open all the way because it hit into the bed. Our kids stayed across the hall in a twin room which was also tight and had a view of the roof. So pay attention to which category of room you book. We ate in Spice and Angelina restaurants for dinner and both were good. This is an expensive hotel but feels very exclusive and safe. We loved our stay here. The only thing it is missing is a hot tub by the pool, because it was not very hot in Dec and the pool was not heated enough for us. Overall it is a top notch hotel.",

The hospitality here in my view is legendary. The staff is superb, in their competence and care. They are courteous, knowledgeable, helpful without being intrusive, and communicate very well.\n\nThis is truly one of the world‘s greatest and most iconic hotels, both in its history and in the team that currently runs it.

The  ample staff were well-trained and attentive; the suite was comfortable and well-appointed. The location is perfect for an early-morning stroll around the lake.

The hotel is one of the most famous and prestigious in Hanoi and it has a rich history.\n\nAs we walked into the hotel, it felt like we were transported back to another era. The hotel has a classic French colonial style, with white walls, green shutters and red tiled roof. The lobby was spacious and elegant with marble floors, chandeliers and antique furniture. Even through we were not hotel guests, the staff were very polite and welcoming. We continued to wander around the hotel to see what it had to offer and were amazed by the variety and quality of the facilities and services. The hotel has a beautiful garden, an outdoor pool, a spa and fitness center and a boutique.  One of the highlights of the hotel has to be its gastronomy. The hotel has several restaurants and bars, each with its own theme and cuisine.\n\nWe had a great time wandering through Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi. The hotel is more than just a place to stay, it is a destination itself, one that we may one day stay at as hotel guests ourselves. It combines the charm and elegance of the past with the comfort and convenience of the present. It is a perfect example of Hanoi's culture, history, and luxury.",

It's the same as the main breakfast place but more attentive, and you get to have the real ca phe with condensed .  Breakfast in the room is  mostly for novelty value. Very good room, we availed ourselves of the bubble bath butler several times. Also there is a free tour of the bomb shelter.",

As a loyal patron of the Sofitel Legend Metropole for the last 16+ years, I have stayed there numerous times and also organized events and seminars. But this time, it was way more special : the hotel very kindly celebrated my 25th stay with a room upgrade, flowers and sweet treats. They even arranged a bottle of champagne! Now this is what luxury is really about: personalized experience and attentive service that make one feel special! Thank you again for your excellent care. Will be back very soon !",

It really brings calm to the end of an adventurous hot humid day. The rooms were so clean and clean ell presented with beautiful decor, bed is so comfortable, had best sleep ever. Then the breakfast was just so incredible with ingredients so fresh and prepared so well that you can taste it.\nNo this is not a paid review either, just an honest one.\nThe dinners were great, even outside on the hotel people watching with a lovely bowl of Pho!\nGreat pool, so clean and so beautiful to swim in at night!\nGreat spa, had a super mummy & daughter treatment. The therapists were so so good.\nThe club benefits with the afternoon tea and evening canopies with champagne and wine is great. A super spread indeed.\nI can’t fault a thing with this beautiful grand hotel and this is from someone who regularly travels in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia staying in 5 star luxury. This place met and exceeded expectations! I will be back",

                                   "A historical landmark and hospitality flagship in Hanoi.\n\nThe hotel is everything a 5 star property should be like. We stayed twice during a family vacation in December in two separate rooms.\n\nHighlights:\n- Amazing breakfast (tip: go to the covered greenhouse). Not only is there a great variety of items, but they are all of great quality, which is not always the case in hotels. Great mix between local flair and western products, with attentive service and quality which can be perceived even in the tablecloths and napkins used. Only suggestion to elevate it even more would be to have a live fruit juice station available To highlight the amazing local fruit varieties\n- Turndown service: replenishing of glass water bottles (plus in sustainability there), laying of slippers and hands down some of the best macarons!\n- Attentive and discreet service\n\nFor next time:\n- Front office had run out of local currency when we asked to exchange money\n- The building is a historical landmark in Hanoi and the decor highlights it, as it should. However, I believe there is an opportunity to make the reception/ front office area more impressive and generate a greater “wow” factor that enhances the property’s uniqueness\n\nWould definitely return!",

The customer service level here goes just as far if not further than European countries and the USA. If you are not staying here, at lease come look at the history of this hotel and check out the restaurant and bar. Last but not least, this location is CENTRAL and close to everything.",

Service was not consistent and while staff was polite, they did not seem to be warm or sincere. We had a minor issue which needed to be clarified. It was addressed early in the morning but we didn’t get the answer until late afternoon after 3 stops at the front desk since “the manager is not here”. Pillows, comforter and sheets are high end and comfortable. They attached all the bath products to the wall which is okay but for the lotion is a bit inconvenient since you have to go the bathroom when you need it. It's also annoying that it's so hard to press the pump and you have to press it several times to get enough amount of shampoo or bath gel for each shower. I understand it's Balmain products but it's kinda cheesy for a 5 star hotel.\nOverall I think this hotel is a bit overrated",

We looked forward to the delicious breakfast spread every morning, and relished the poolside cocktails in the afternoons. The concierge service was valuable, and the warm greetings from the staff at every turn made us feel special and welcomed. The spa treatment was soothing, and the macarons left at turn down were the perfect way to finish off our night. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer. Hopefully, we'll be back.",

I loved some of the flowers composition across the hotel, art pieces by themselves. The historic visit of the hotel and its war bunker was very interesting.",

                                   "During my recent 9-night sojourn at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi, I was struck by the grandeur and history of the hotel making this an unforgettable stay. The hotel is an architectural masterpiece, that stands as a beacon of French elegance and Vietnamese culture.  My wife was on a medical mission in Hanoi and I was left alone at the Metropole working remotely.  The Metropole became my sanctuary - I could have stayed here forever.\n\nThe hotel is a Grand Hotel but it's just right - not too big but big enough to have everything you want. Great spa, five fantastic restaurants, a gym, a pool and so many quiet spots to sit and read or work.  You feel the spirits of all the luminaries that have stayed here - Charlie Chaplin, Somerset Maugham, and Graham Greene are a few. And you sense the pivotal moments of history that have occurred (and still occur) at this hotel - it has a profound sense of place.\n\nThe staff cherishes the Hotel's history and prominence and they provide a sense of warm caring hospitality that is unmatched.  Attentive, professional, and friendly but again dignified and reserved - in no way overbearing.  I will go back next year and look forward to staying at the Metropole - so many great stories that I want to make this hotel a part of my story.",

They were both beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean.\n\nOur interactions with the hotel staff were always friendly, sincere and effective. There is a sense that this is a good place to work and that the staff are happy to be there.\n\nWe enjoyed our time at the hotel immensely.\n\nFrom the airport transfers, to the food on offer for breakfast lunch and dinner, the well managed pool and the fun bamboo bar, we couldn’t have been happier with our stay.\n\nThe only constructive feedback would be that our second room, which we stayed in on the second of our two stays (room 237) had less effective air conditioning than our first room (room 305).",

There are areas where there is no shade and it will get hot. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here. Don't forget to check out the underground bomb shelter and the museums inside the buildings, they're easy to miss. Great place to take kids. Some drinks and snacks are available to purchase inside.",

But we walked further in and found many little buildings which contain artifacts excavated from before. The doors to these displays were opaque and it was not obvious that there're things to see inside.\nI'm glad we spent more time to discover these. Perhaps better signage should be put up to direct visitors.",

The Imperial Citadel of Thang Long functioned as a royal court during 1800s and became a complex of imperial palaces. It became a prison chamber of French soldiers during World War 2 and was severely impacted by war. Today, it's listed as one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites. At the entrance of the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, there's a mini-exhibit showcasing the history, culture, and traditions of Vietnam and its citizen. You can also visit other attractions such as Hanoi Flagtower and Vietnam Military History Museum to know more about the Vietnamese history and war vehicles used during the world war.",

Also the artefacts excavated from underground are very diverse and reflect the rich heritage of culture, architecture and religion throughout different dynasties of feudal Vietnam. There are 5 exhibitions focusing on different topics, all of which are worth seeing (with great care and attention).\nThe landscape is beautiful and peaceful with many green trees and colourful flowers and wildlife (birds).\nNext time I will bring homemade food and have some little picnic here.",

You can see the whole thing in about 15-20 minutes, and it’s honestly not super interesting or beautiful. Worth a quick stop especially if you’re seeing the Ho Chi Minh mausoleum / museum nearby, but don’t expect to be blown away.\n\nEDIT: After reading other reviews I realize we missed virtually all the actual exhibitions here and just saw the main palace building. TBH I don’t blame us, the road to the other exhibitions seemed to be under construction and there wasn’t any map or signage indicating that there was anything at all to see that way.",

                                   "My family of six made the trek out to the Imperial Citadel from our hotel near the cathedral in the old quarter. We paid a total of 90k vnd (30k for people 15 and over) for admission. The ticket office is at the south gate side, not north like it shows on Google maps. Our three youngest children got in free. We were not expecting to enjoy our time as much as we did. Like other reviewers mention, there are many exhibits. It's important to note that not all the exhibits have a/c. We were glistening by the end of our visit, for sure. But it didn't take away from our experience. You can make your trip as fast or as long as you want. We spent a total of two hours at the main site (Southgate, exhibits, military bunker, military headquarter, and princess pagoda). When you exit, you can cross the street to see exhibit 18, or the archeological site, where you will need to show your ticket again to enter. It's an interesting walk through the excavated areas. We spent an additional 20 minutes or so at this site.",

You will be amazed by how the castles are built with underground and steep stairs. The exhibitions are fascinating as the antiquities are restored and displayed around different exhibition halls.

There are two sides to it, definitely visit the old side with the excavations (closest to the National Assembly building). This will give you an idea of how this place has been continuously occupied for over 4000 years. Almost no one was there when I visited, I think tour buses only take people to the other side where the Citadel and other buildings are, which of course is also must visit. So much history, if you don’t leave in awe you haven’t gotten the sense of the place.",

A couple of historical reenactments which had all the entertainment value of an elementary school drama production.\nThe tour rushed through some of the museum type exhibit areas which meant time to read about the displays was cut short.\nOddly the tour abruptly ended about a 1/2 kilometre away from the starting point and outside of the citadel grounds. Which meant one needs to find their own way back to the entrance and parking area along a busy street with terrible footpaths. If you aren't familiar with the area this would be quite disconcerting.\nFrankly, if one is set on visiting here, do it in the daytime and not with a tour.\nThe grounds are pleasant and the citadel is moderately interesting. But be clear, it's not particularly significant historically; the highlights appeared to be ground water wells that were a few hundred years old. Angkor Wat, it's not.",

The museum displays many artifacts excavated onsite which helps understand the culture and influences that make Vietnam what it is today. Also located here that I found quite fascinating is a bunker that was used by the Vietnam government to discuss tactical strategies during the Vietnam War.",

I learned so much about Vietnam’s rich history and culture through the detailed exhibits and ancient artifacts displayed throughout the site. The architecture is absolutely stunning, with beautifully preserved structures that transport you back in time. Walking through the citadel, I felt as if I was experiencing the grandeur of Vietnam’s past firsthand.",

Not only is it beautiful but the many buildings and teh bunker in the cellar tells and incredible story and it is very well illustrated in Vietnamese, French as well as English. I highly recommend a visit.",

Just a heads up, it costs 70k to get in, and don’t trust Google Maps on this one – the real entrance is playing hide and seek and it’s 250 meters closer than shown on Maps.",

This did not include phones but I am not sure where they draw the line.\n\nI don't think museum is an accurate description of this place as it is more a collection of things from majority the Vietnam war. Very little effort goes into explaining anything and displaying it any meaningful way.\n\nWith so much history we can learn from I wish they did a better job of accurately presenting this.\n\nAlso, just as a side note the toilets here are the worst I've seen in South East Asia. It seems they haven't been cleaned for months.",

                                   "One of the places you can't miss in Hanoi, and situated almost next to the UNESCO site ICTL ( review separately available ), the Military History Museum is full of war paraphernalia including i.a. arrows, guns, and knives. This history related to these weapons ( and it's characteristics ) is adequately explained, both in English and the local language, and one can also find references to the Vietnam ( or American ) War here.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a big and old Soviet jet as well as a tank kept on display, and as one goes ahead there are samples of bombs of various sizes kept apart from the bomb releasing machines, which were used during the war, and some of which were unearthed later in the century at various places across the country.\n\nDo note that the Museum is closed on Mon and Fri, and also during 11:30 am to 1:00 pm. I couldn't get the time to see the second building. This is also the only entry point to the Flag Tower. If one loves museums, it's unlikely that the whole museum can be seen in one visit, and will likely require two visits given the time constraints.\n\nThe museum should consider remaining open till 6 pm ( as opposed to 4:30 pm currently ) or so and/or not closing for the mid-duration of 2hrs. The entry fee is VND 40,000, and there is a coffee machine near the entry and also a restaurant inside.",

Information was hard to gather, but that’s what I have. The remaining small items clothes, firearms, etc are okay. The flag tower is cool. And the rubble of ex-planes is artistic in a eashhh kind of way. It’s hard to complain for 30,000 dong. But unless you haven’t been to other war museums in SE Asia, it’s not overly different. Although Vietnam history buffs may like it, but be prepared for….slight to not slight propaganda, biased signage and displays set up by people who may not have actual military experience 😁, no matter what you think of the war itself. But it’s all part of the experience I guess.\nThe morale of the story is, don’t take your 5 year old boy whom you’ve been promising tanks and planes for a week. Quite sad, plus he had trouble understanding how they even got the tanks out since they’re so heavy!🤣",

But there wasn't any exhibits to I tract with. It's a lot of reading small texts and looking at artifacts (if they have it). Cool sculptures and fascinating exhibits, just wish there was more things to interact with and a souvenir shop to at least get some books.",

Either way, the move is not signposted on the museum website or at the gates in front of the existing museum - they should tell you BEFORE you pay for a ticket to see this totally gutted museum.\n\nTo the existing (now old) museum curators - why on earth have you replaced the now-moved exhibitions with an exhibition about the Belarus’ resistance of the Nazis during WW2? How is that relevant to Vietnam’s military history?\n\nComplete waste of time - don’t come here.",

                                   "Skip it! Confirming what other reviews have already stated: the tanks are gone and several pieces have been moved to another museum. Poorly maintained exhibitions. The most disappointing aspect of this visit was the rude staff at the ticket booth—she essentially was not having a good day. There were two parties ahead of me in the queue: a Vietnamese couple and a German couple. The female staff at the ticket booth acted dismissive and annoyed when issuing the tickets with German couple and then myself. She threw at me the ticket and the change. The male in the Vietnamese couple for whatever reason was pretty rude, giving stares, rolling his eyes at westerners and walking in front of us as we were visiting the rooms, mind you that there was plenty of space around but he purposeful would invade others’ personal space and laugh as if his intention was to trigger others to engage—the woman with him looked notably ashamed. Not a reflection of Viet people’s behavior toward westerners (at least from my experience), and perhaps just some self-selection bias into who comes to this type of museum. I was excited to visit this museum to learn narratives that are often not told in the west about the Vietnam war;  but my experience was just overshadowed by the rude staff and the local visitor’s attitude and behavior.",

However, I made sure to plan my visit again for the following day.\n\nThe museum showcases an impressive level of detail with a wide range of exhibitions, including weapons and photographs. If you have an interest in gaining a deeper understanding of history, I would recommend allocating around 1-1.5 hours for your visit.\n\nOn a less positive note, I encountered an issue with the security guard at the entrance. Upon stepping in and taking a quick look around for just a few seconds, the guard shouted at me in a loud and rude manner, insisting that I purchase a ticket. It would have been appreciated if he had approached the situation with a calmer demeanor. After all, I was there to enjoy my visit and relax in the city. It's important to remember that as a visitor, I don't work for the museum or the guard. Nonetheless, I found the situation somewhat amusing and shared a lighthearted response with him.\n\nDespite the encounter with the security guard, the military museum itself offers a valuable experience, providing in-depth insights into history. I hope my review helps others plan their visit accordingly.",

                                   'Hang Son Dong Cave is the largest cave in the world\n\nHang Son Dong Cave is a wonder of nature. This cave is located in Vietnam, with a length of 4 kilometers, a width of about 100 meters, and a height of about 240 meters.\n\nHang Son Dong Cave is one of a network of 150 caves that have been discovered so far, as well as a large number of caves that have yet to be discovered.\n\nWhat is interesting is that this cave does not meet the specifications of other caves, such as the darkness and the fact that it contains bats and other terrifying atmospheres. On the contrary, you will not find anything of this at all. Rather, what distinguishes it is its amazing size to the extent that it contains a large forest inside it and a running river, and the exciting thing is that the humidity inside the cave is so high that the condensation of water vapor leads to the formation of what looks like clouds in the sky of the cave!!\n\nSurprisingly, despite the huge size of these caves, but the explorers say that you do not pay attention to them unless you are directly in front of them.\nDiscover this amazing cave in the Phong Nha-Keh Pang National Park in Vietnam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, located in north-central Vietnam, about 500 km south of the capital, Hanoi.\n\nIt is said that it was discovered by a local man in 1991 but in 2009 the British speleologists announced their discovery of this cave.\n\n"The World of Traveler" conveyed to you some pictures of this amazing cave. The pictures were taken by German photographer Carsten Peter in 2010, and Karsten had participated in a campaign to discover these amazing caves with the aim of documenting them scientifically and in the media:',

H’Anetta (our tour guide) was very professional, fun, passionate, and very knowledgeable. On top of that, the porters and safety assistants were also spectacular and further enhanced our experience. they were incredibly helpful and the most kind hearted people.\n\nThere were 3 campsites and each one of them had its own character. Waking up to the view is to die for, sometimes it felt like I was on another planet.\n\nThe trek was challenging but also very fun, plus the safety assistants are, again, very helpful. There was a great balance between going through caves and jungles. And occasionally, you’d cross rivers too!\n\nOverall, reconnecting with nature was a success 😎",

It is not for everyone; you will sweat profusely, not shower, get muddy, scramble through tight spaces, and ascend a large wall with ropes. I loved every minute of it.\n\nThe Son Doong Cave is nearly 9 km long, and the volume is up to 38.5 million cubic meters, making this cave the largest natural cave on the planet 🌏. It has many complex and giant stalactites (over 80m high), ancient rain forests 🏞 growing inside the cave, its own ecosystem, weather, or a mysterious underground river that no explorer has yet discovered to the end of it. It was indeed an adventure that is like nothing else in this world.",

Only properly discovered in 2009, the cave is so large a 40-story skyscraper could fit at its highest point and at the widest point a Boeing 747 could glide through easily. Located in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, less people have seen the inside of this magical cave than have stood at the summit of Mount Everest.\nSon Doong, the largest cave in the world, only opened to the public in 2013. The vast expanse could house a 40-floor skyscraper with room to spare. But if you want to explore this cave, located in Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, be prepared to shell out the big bucks: a four-day expedition costs nearly $4,000.",

Although trekking was a bit tough, it was 100% worth every last bit of energy and talking to the safety assistants and friends made it more fun than tiring. Climbing under, over, and through rocks was so exciting and I could not have been more elated by this once-in-a-lifetime experience (I'm so jealous if you get to go more than once).\n\nThere cannot be enough compliments said about the safety assistants. Incredibly kind, caring, and funny as well if you can understand them. Took care of everyone equally but understood when sometimes someone needed extra help.\n\nFood was so delicious it makes every other restaurant in Vietnam look bad, and that's not because we were tired from trekking. The food was genuinely incredible, rivaling and surpassing my Viet grandma's cooking (cháu xin lỗi bà ngoại hihi). Oxalis has made meals prepared by anyone else disappointing.\n\nI commend Oxalis for all its efforts in making the experience extremely eco friendly, it was obvious that they take great care in keeping the cave as untouched as possible. Overall this experience could not be what it is without Oxalis so all the praise to them!",

The front pagoda is impressive as you enter the grounds, but you are greater surprised at the vastness, and serenity of the gardens, monuments, stupas, shrines and temples. Believed to be the oldest in Saigon, and away from the usual tourist area, this temple is a an absolute treasure, and well worth the visit.",

Entrance fee is 40k and you can take a bus from Cao Bang, the bus drives you directly to the waterfalls- takes about 2h. Maybe don’t go on the weekend, i can imagine it’s more crowded then. Also the bus only drives every hour now, not every 30min, maybe due to Covid. The bus stop where we got on it was at this location: Cüra Häng Nôi Thât Gö Minh Hòa",

It's a long way to go but totally worth it. Stunning, cheap to enter, absolutely beautiful to enjoy. Could spend hours there.",

                                   "40k entrance fee, then a further 50k if you want to take the boat closer to the waterfall. I chose to take the boat and enjoyed it very much, you do get wet with all the spray from the waterfall! It is very touristy but that’s to be expected, I was the only westerner there though at the time so expect people to stare a little😅 Lots of motorbike parking and there’s toilets and lots of nearby stalls selling souvenirs (no food that I can remember). The area is beautiful overall!",

                                   "The road from Cao Bang to Ban Gioc is scenic and well maintained. Even when we drove in rain and fog on a motorcycle, we enjoyed the ride.\n\nFee to get in: 40,000VND/person\nMotorcycle parking: 3,000VND\n\nThe waterfalls, however, was underwhelming. It's a hit or miss and there's not a lot of water when we arrived. We took the boat to bring us closer to the cascades (50,000VND/person), water was shallow and we can see the bottom. I read that they release water from the dam on schedule and January is not rainy season, so we were unlucky.\n\nOn the other hand, it's very interesting to learn that this waterfalls and river borders China and Vietnam. You can see China an arm's length away and the Chinese tourists also having their own boats full of tourists.\n\nFor the best experience, ask/research the time of water release from the dams.",

You can catch the local bus from Cao Bang directly to the falls for 85,000, running every 30 mins. The drive over there is very beautiful also. I also recommend a visit to Chùa Phật Tích Trúc Lâm Bản Giốc (buddist temple) while you’re in the area - from the top you can get an interesting birds-eye view of the falls.",

It is renowned for its crystal-clear mineral water and scenic views backed by tropical trees. The beach has been named Sao due to the large number of starfish that used to move towards its shore or swim under the water in the evenings. Alongside a few restaurants, visitors can rent chairs and engage in various water sports activities.",

We decided to get out of our hotel and try somewhere new and which had been recommended. But it fell short.\n\nIt would be good option for people with families and on a budget.\n\nThere was a lot of activity, and people where happy to approach you and offer fruit, water activities etc.\n\nIf you looked out to sea, it was ok. The water had a lot of sediment from the storm last night - as expected.  But... if you turn around facing the trees and there was soo much plastic/litter. So sad.\n\nFor adults, best pick seemed to be Paradiso.\nOr walk up the furthest end of the beach for some nature.\n\nWe heard there were sandflies, so we used bug spray before we walked up to Paradiso. Also, fans of swings from palm trees - most at Paradiso were out of action. Low season I guess.\n\nIf you're a fussy tourist and very used to clean beaches, splurge and head to Khem and pay for a lounger /food/drinks from the northern end. I think the southern end you can camp on the sand and enjoy for free though it's much busier :)\n\nIt's about 255k in Vietnamese Dong from Praha Hotel using Grab. Lucky our driver waited for us, so we could turn around and head to Khem.",

While the sand was soft and the water clean, the rest of the beach seemed a little run down. There was a lot of garbage along the shore and many boats blocking the view. You may have to walk a little to find a nice spot. Maybe it’s due to being off-season on which the beach is less well maintained.\n\nThe facilities seemed good on the other hand. There were a few restaurant and cafe options. You could also join water sport activities. Shower and toilet were also available for a small fee (20k-30k).",

Many fishing boats moored a few hundred metres offshore giving it that distinctive Southeast Asian feel. Deck chairs and umbrellas are for rental and plent of vendors where you can buy a fresh coconut juice, snacks or a cold beer.\n\nAccess is via a small winding dirt track from the main road and a large treelined parking area (with more vendors). I was there in September so not overly touristy, or crodwded at all and was easy to get a quiet spot of my own.\n\nSwimming was great. Despite being slightly overcast, it was still very warm. A relaxing day out in a beautiful spot. Recommended. Easy to get to in around 45 minutes from Duong Dong.",

If you would like to swim in a sea of ​​plastic waste, you have come to the right place. Sao Beach certainly has the whitest beaches and a blue sea. There would be a lot of potential here. But it's just littered. If each of the white tourists here took 3 pieces of trash with them (#take3forthesea), then things would look different here. But rather take beautiful Instagram pictures on a palm tree. Sad and ridiculous. Just like the beach bar. 1 coconut 60,000 dong, which can usually be purchased throughout Vietnam for 20,000 dong. The owners don't seem to mind this dump either. They only clear something away on their 3m beach.\n\nIf you want to travel more sustainably, please bring your own reusable bottles and cans. Many accommodations have water refill stations, so you don't have to buy water in bottled plastic bottles. Avoid the plastic bags around your drinking cups (just use Google Translate to show it in Vietnamese). Drink your beer from bottles (they are refilled here after all) and not from cans.

I think the Bamboo Air jet arrives near 1500 hours. Keep your phone camera facing west toward the water & aircraft suddenly appear in site.\n\nThere's a few cafe's along the beach that offer cold drinks...like Tiger beer and that is great. The bay is quite sheltered and the water is usually very clear & calm for swimming safely.\n\nTo get there you will travel north out of Con Dao town along a scenic and mountainous well paved road. Just make sure you follow to the right at the fork in the road and then turn left on the next wide road to the beach...if not you will be at the airport and have to turn back. Well worth the ride & relax at the beach all day.\n\nThe sunsets are spectacular as the beach faces west.",

                                   "Tháp Pô Klông Garai, located in Phan Rang-Tháp Chàm, Ninh Thuận Province, Vietnam, is an impressive Cham temple complex dating back to the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Named after King Po Klong Garai, who is believed to have ruled Champa in the late 12th century, the complex serves as an important cultural and religious site for the Cham people.\n\nThe temple complex features several well-preserved towers, with the main tower, or kalan, standing out for its intricate brickwork and carvings. This main tower is dedicated to King Po Klong Garai and is adorned with statues and reliefs depicting Hindu deities, as well as scenes from Cham mythology. The complex also includes a gate tower (gopura) and a fire tower (kosagrha), each showcasing distinct architectural styles and details typical of Cham temple design.\n\nThe annual Kate Festival, held at Tháp Pô Klong Garai, is a significant event that attracts many visitors. This festival celebrates Cham culture and includes traditional music, dance, and rituals to honor ancestors and deities.\n\nTháp Pô Klong Garai stands as a testament to the rich history and cultural heritage of the Cham people, offering visitors a glimpse into the architectural and religious traditions of ancient Champa.",

If you can should get a guide to explain the history behind the building. Ticket for entrance is 20k, parking bike is 5k. It is pretty sunny so should visit in early morning or late afternoon. Walking about 10 minutes from the entrance to the towels, no need electronic car. Easy walk as well.",

                                   "Let me tell you about my trip to Khu Di Tích Xẻo Quýt in Đồng Tháp. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but that ended up being a good thing!\n\nI knew it was a historical site from the Vietnam War, but I wasn't sure what to expect.  It turns out it's this massive area, way bigger than I imagined.  There's a section that's completely preserved, with parts of the old base camp and even some wartime tunnels. It felt really eerie walking through those tunnels, but it also gave me a huge appreciation for the resourcefulness of the fighters.\n\nThe other half of the area is this incredible nature reserve. We took a small boat down these narrow canals lined with lush trees.  It was so peaceful, and the only sounds were the birds and the gentle lapping of the water.  We even saw a family of monkeys swinging through the branches!  It was a welcome contrast to the intensity of the historical site.\n\nOverall, Xẻo Quýt was a surprising mix of history and nature.  It's definitely worth a visit if you're in Đồng Tháp, especially if you're interested in both the war and seeing a beautiful part of Vietnam.",

I’ve visited a fair number of animal sanctuaries and this one had such a good feel to it, I love the fact they have such a strong focus on releasing primates back into the wild where possible. The sanctuary staff member that showed us around spoke really passionately about each of the species and the work that the centre does - I left feeling really well informed. I highly recommend visiting if you come to Cat Tien National Park!",

There was genuine compassion for the animals and also local people, with projects to offer alternate income and reduce poaching.\nThe centre has a very high success rate of rehabilitation and releasing the animals into the national park and so it was lovely that they had a bright future, unlike zoos or any kind of tourist trap 'sanctuary'. You can buy merchandise to support the centre too. Definitely recommend!",

You really get to understand the situation with the animals in that area. Great work team, keep it up!\nFirst, catch the boat over to the park, from there head to the main office to get tickets to the centre, then a small boat ride there. Tour starts at 8.30am so aim to catch the first ferry over to the island around 8pm for enough time to get tickets.\n60K for the boat\n300K for entrance into the centre (100% goes towards the centre).\nWould highly recommend this to anyone visiting the national park!",

                                   "Imagine walking into a place where Chinese architecture meets Islamic artistry- all set against the vibrant backdrop of Cholon. It's like if a kung fu movie set and a desert oasis had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a cultural gem in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the blend of styles: intricate Chinese woodwork meets Islamic calligraphy, with a splash of green that feels refreshingly cool amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a peaceful retreat where you can hear yourself think—if you're not too busy admiring the beautiful pond and lush courtyard.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a culture vulture, or just someone looking for a quiet place to escape the city noise, this temple is a must-visit. It’s not just a religious site; it's a testament to the diverse tapestry that makes up Saigon.\n\nSo, if you're in town, pop in and soak up some tranquility and history. You might just find yourself feeling a bit more Zen!",

You get to see fields of plants growing on the water making it look like an actual field. There are insane amounts of birds in the trees and the trees themselves are also impressive. Actual mangroves. You can take a bout tour over the river ways which is actually the only way to get deeper into the forest so you should do it. It is really touristy but for me that was no problem especially since it wasn't too expensive.",

My favourite part was the tour with sampan, the pace is slower and you will have the time to observe: there are many different types of birds, especially early in the morning and during the sunset when they return to their nest. A speedboat will bring you further to an observatory tower. There are many eateries and restaurants, a must try is the freshly squeezed sugarcane drink and the grilled eggs in shell.",

Tra Su Forest has changed drastically and gone viral in just a decade. However, the firm that operates the forest wanted to transform it into a theme park rather than maintaining the beautiful nature. There’re too many unnecessary decorations and details.

There are herons, egrets, cormorants, and other waterfowl to watch. The mangrove with Melaleuca trees (tea trees) is beautiful.\nThere are shops with local products and foodstalls.",

We arrived late in the day so not many tourists were left which meant our tour was almost a private one. The motor boats were stopped whenever birds were in view to allow for photographs, but we did see more birds along the boardwalks (probably because of the time of day was almost dusk). The bamboo boardwalks were a little slippery in the wet weather but we got used to it very easily. Very peaceful and tranquil walking around, the only noise was that of the birds.",

A towering pagoda looks over the grounds and completes the Buddhist architecture wonderfully. The temple was built in 1958, and was the centre of Buddhist activism in the early 1960s. Home to Thich Quang Duc, the heroic monk that gave his life in protest of the persecution of Bhuddists by the Sth Vietnamese government. His monument is nearby the temple, and a visit to both is absolutely essential.",

Wir wurden sofort von vielen, jungen Vietnamesen umzingelt und so herzlich willkommen geheißen, wie ich es noch nie erlebt habe.\nWir haben ein kostenloses Abendessen, Tee, Wasser und Süßigkeiten bekommen.\nWir waren sprachlos und es war alles ganz fantastisch. Wir haben sogar Originale Tempelkleidung bekommen, um uns etwas wohler zu fühlen - im Angesicht der Zeremonie.\nZusätzlich wurde die Ansprache für uns simultan auf englisch übersetzt, sodass wir alles verfolgen konnten. Zum Schluss konnten wir uns sogar mit allen anderen den „Segen“ abholen. Es war wirklich fantastisch und kam so unerwartet.\nEigentlich wollten wir nur ein paar Bilder vom Tempel machen und dann wieder gehen…\nAus eigentlich geplanten 15 Minuten wurden fast 3 Stunden mit tollen Erfahrungen, sehr sehr viel Gastfreundschaft, Herzlichkeit und Spiritualität.\nEin Glück, dass wir zur richtigen Zeit am richtigen Ort waren.\n\n(Translated by Google)\nIncredibly great experience.\nWe happened to be there for a special meditation festival with a lecture by the Master.\nWe were literally forced to come in and look around a bit. We were immediately surrounded by many young Vietnamese people and welcomed as warmly as I have ever experienced.\nWe got free dinner, tea, water and sweets.\nWe were speechless and everything was fantastic. We were even given original temple clothing to make us feel a little more comfortable in the face of the ceremony.\nIn addition, the speech was simultaneously translated into English for us so that we could follow everything. At the end we were even able to receive the “blessing” with everyone else. It was really fantastic and so unexpected.\nActually we just wanted to take a few pictures of the temple and then leave...\nThe originally planned 15 minutes turned into almost 3 hours with great experiences, a lot of hospitality, warmth and spirituality.\nLuckily we were in the right place at the right time.",

A statue shows the two Trung sisters (from the 1st century AD) kneeling with their arms raised in the air. Some say the statue shows the sisters, who had been proclaimed the queens of the Vietnamese, about to dive into a river. They are said to have drowned themselves rather than surrender in the wake of their defeat at the hands of the Chinese.",

I found the boat a bit expensive (about 17 dollars return for 2 people) the journey takes like 4 minutes on a run down, noisy boat. I would also advise you not to eat in the restaurant around the light house. They are very pricey for tourists and the food is not very good.",

The space is very huge with chairs and toilet for your convenience. Highly recommend visiting this over Coffee museum 👌",

With such a wealth of exhibits, boredom is simply not an option in this museum. The entrance fee is only $$15k Dong, and parking is free.

They have 3 sections:  culture, biodiversity, and history of the central highland. The history section is closed for maintenance when we were there (In Feb 2023). They also have an exhibition of photos in the 1950s about the highlands people life. Very interesting. We spent about 2 hours in here. The museum has a big park as well.

It looks to be a subset of the museum of Ethnology in Hanoi which is worthy of one single visit.\n\nDak Lak visit strategy is to get this and the coffee museum out of the way. Skip the Coffee Village and fly out as soon as possible.\n\nIn terms of interestingness, the main exhibition will take you 30-45 minutes to cover.\n\nCanteen on site is not worth eating at. Was not able to discern if I could visit the Palace across the way but there was a heavy downpour.\n\nStaff are absolutely kind and friendly but in the end, in a city with literally zero to do, I should have been on a plane outta here.

Les Anglais sont bien sûr présents tout comme les Australiens, les Allemands, les Suisses, les Autrichiens ou encore les Américains. Le musée est climatisé, afin de protéger les collections, et est donc une visite agréable à faire par forte chaleur... Le prix est différent si on est vietnamien ou étranger. Les étrangers payent 70.000 VND soit 2€53. Je dis ça parce que sur les sites comme Tripadvisor, Google etc.il y a des chouineurs qui hurlent à la discrimination...

                                   "Exhibition of uniforms and weapons from the Middle Ages to modern times. Although there are numerous museums in Germany on this subject due to history, I have never seen such a rich and diverse collection, which is also presented so excellently. While in other places you usually only see the armor and uniforms on clothes racks, here very elaborately designed dolls are equipped with them, whose appearance always fits perfectly with the countries of origin. Great work!",

Just hope that the world could be a better place without war.\n\nBy the way, ticket was charged with 70K VND. There are 4  exhibition buildings and some have air-con, some don't have.

The exhibition is located on the first floor of an old building behind the Tourist Information Center and includes displays of handicrafts, historical artifacts, and photographs. Although some descriptions may be faded, the museum is worth a quick visit that can be covered in under an hour. Admission is free.",

It is quite dated and a bit sad looking but you can’t really expect a lot from something that is free.\n\nThe information in there was very interesting just maybe needs a more modern approach to displaying 👍\n\nMaybe if a small fee were to be expected maybe some renovations could be made 👍",

Paid entrance fee, early morning ride up the misty, nature filled, fresh air....I was filled with excitement. Did not see any visitors along the way, except for a young local couple on a motorbike.\nSaw a deserted Catholic Church, some bungalows for rent and trees.\nHad an eerie encounter near a large stone boulder, felt someone's watching me, when my bike suddenly stop. Unable to start.\nLong story short, I rolled down the hill for about 1-2km before I was to start my bike and left the place.\nIt's a very spiritual area.",

                                   "We had up-and-down emotion to get to the Bavi National Park and I will summarize as belows:\n- Up to the elevation 400m, road is terrible due to road maintenance. We had to wait for 10 min for a concrete truck to work across the road. It is so crowded and dusty without any warning in the beginning of the road.\n- From elevation 400m to 700m, a quite good road to go will full of plants around.\n- From elevation 700m to 1100m, a high slope can make your brake broken down when going down. Be careful with this popular problem there. We also made that similar difficulty and a little bit scary to go down.\nOn the cote 1100, it is so special to see the fog and clouds going around. A good moment to enjoy the travel.\nNote that you will buy a ticket at the foot of the park, vnd 60k per person excluded your vehicle fee.\n\nLưu ý rất dễ mất phanh khi đi xuống từ cao độ 1100m đến 700m vì đường rất dốc. Nên chuẩn bị sẵn số điện thoại trong trường hợp cần cứu hộ xe.",

It was basically a lot of spread out locations along the mountain and they’re all far from one and other, most of the time we were on the drive way. I prefer being able to walk around in nature. Maybe the right way to enjoy bavi is staying in a nice resort which has access to lakes or waterfall with out having to move around.

                                   "Great place to visit. The Two Peaks, Ho Chi Minh Temple, the Ruins and the Cactus Dome are popular places to visit.\n\nFrom Ha Noi take bus 74 until the end of the route. There take a taxi (ask the place you’re staying for a number) and use that for the last part of the trip. If you’re a bit more adventurous you can try and find your way to line 110 that stops in front of the park.\n\nIt’s a long way up towards the two peaks. Going by motorbike and hike up the two peaks is advisable. Hiking all the way from the park gate can be done, but following the tarmac road is maybe not that glamorous.\n\n60K entrance fee / 5K for motorbike",

This underground village, located in Dong Ha, was not only used as bomb shelters but also housed a school, hospital, and theater. The tunnels are well-preserved and offer visitors an immersive experience into the lives of the people who sought shelter there. Exploring the tunnels can be surprising and hiring a tour guide is recommended for those unfamiliar with directions.",

It's mind-blowing to walk through the entire tunnel system and get to know the local people's stories during the Vietnam war through two documenaries at the reception (/a projecting room)\n\nWe met a lovely gentlman who is muted and lives in the museum, whoes stories we later learnt from a local tour guide. He was there when the locals were digging the tunnel.\n\nGo down to the meeting room and follow the sign to the third floor, eventually, you'll be led to a beautiful beach.",

Yes, you heard right. I have never paid such an amount to enter a small museum, but I agreed. It's a very (very) small house, I will say not much to see, only one floor.  After 30 seconds, I realized there was nothing more to see.  I turned to one of the workers there, and said to him: That's it ?  is this the house  Two and a half rooms ?!  He obviously didn't like the question and made an annoyed face at me.  Save your money and time, simply a waste of time.  This is the kind of place where entry should be free ! 40,000vnd ??

It might have seen better days, but still a good place to put in some time and explore the place for an hour.\n\nHad a Viet tour guide that really explain this house in depth and what happened to the occupants",

                                   "Let me tell you about this hidden gem I stumbled upon in Sa Dec - Nhà cổ Huỳnh Thủy Lê. It's this old house tucked away on a bustling street, and from the outside, it doesn't quite hit you how grand it is. But step inside, and wow.\n\nThe minute you walk through the doorway, you're transported back in time. Dark, polished wood dominates the interior, with intricate carvings that look like they must have taken forever to create. The air is thick with the scent of old wood and something else I couldn't quite place, maybe history? There's a real sense of reverence in the place, like it's seen so much life pass through its doors.\n\nThe coolest part for me was the blend of styles. You can see the Chinese influence in the ornate decorations, but then there are these details that feel very French, with high ceilings and big windows. It's like the house itself tells a story of cultural exchange, which isn't surprising considering Sa Dec's history.\n\nI wouldn't say it's the most interactive place - it's more like a time capsule you get to wander through. But if you're into history and beautiful architecture, definitely don't miss it.  There's a calmness to the place, a real escape from the noise of the city outside.  I left feeling like I had a glimpse into the life of a wealthy Sa Dec family from a bygone era.",

Every Saturday and Sunday night at 9pm, this remarkable dragon sculpture puts on a spectacular show by spouting fire and water from its head near the eastern bank of the Han River. The best spots to witness this spectacle are the cafes along the river's eastern bank to the north of the bridge.",

If you're on an extended visit to Saigon, the Museum of Fine Arts might be worth a 45-60 minute quick visit, but I wouldn't rank it as a must see attraction for the city.\n\nAlthough housed in a beautiful historic colonial building, it's quite run down and in need of repair. There's only a few rooms throughout the museum with AC, so it can be a bit uncomfortable on a warm day. The collection doesn't really jump out as exciting or expansive, but it's only 30k dong for entry and located quite central in the city.",

You can visit it in less than an hour if you make it quick and focus on the highlights.\n\nThe buildings are from the founding era and worth a visit alone. The museum contains three different buildings, but the most noteworthy is the first, the main building.\n\nThe building themselves are old, and they have only an aircon in certain rooms. Fans are not everywhere present, but the window shades are closed, so there is some protection from the sun.\n\nThey don't offer any map for orientation in the museum. Also, there is a lack of signage, especially for orientation in the buildings.\n\nOn a side note, security seems pretty lax. Only security cameras are present in most rooms, and the staff present seems absent. That's not the best way to protect precious art.",

The collection is also very interesting and diverse ranging from bronze, ceramic and wood to modern fine arts spanning 3 buildings.\n\nHowever, as others have pointed out, there's no AC in the building so it gets very warm inside. There is very little in the way of descriptions of what you're seeing. If you time to kill and an interest in fine art, is an interesting spot.",

                                   "Exploring Vietnamese Art: A Visit to the Museum\n\nThe museum itself is worth a visit. It’s a combination of Chinese, Vietnamese, and French architecture. It was from a Chinese Vietnamese business man who also helped construct other important and influential buildings that are still in use today.\n\nIt’s common to see people taking pictures of the building because of its beauty rather than the art pieces.\n\nBecause of budget constraints, the museum houses some average art pieces that suffer from poor quality management. However, there are still some famous paintings by Vietnamese artists, such as Nguyen Gia Tri and Le Thi Luu, which are admired by the Vietnamese people.\n\nFor a young country like Vietnam, despite its rapid development, ensuring enough food for everyone is the priority before they can focus on art and its appreciation. Hopefully, in the future, the museum will add more quality pieces to its collection.\n\nA thorough trip might take around 2.5 hours.\nTicket: 30k/person",

Where is the address of Ngoc Hoang Pagoda?\n\nJade Emperor Pagoda, also known as Ngoc Hoang Palace (Phuoc Hai Tu)  is located at 73, Mai Thi Luu Street, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City. This is an ancient temple familiar to Saigon people and tourists with its attractive beauty, a place to pray for children, to pray for a sacred fate.\n\nAlthough it is far from the city center, the road to the temple is relatively easy. However, when planning to visit, you also need to pay attention to the problem of Ngoc Hoang Pagoda open until what time? The temple is open every day, so you can visit and pray for blessings anytime from 7am to 6pm, especially on the 1st and the full moon from 5am to 7pm.\n\n2. History of the Jade Emperor Pagoda in Saigon\n\nThe Jade Emperor Pagoda in Saigon was built in the early twentieth century, by a Chinese named Luu Minh, himself Luu Dao Nguyen. Initially, this was the temple to worship the Jade Emperor, and was also used by Luu Minh as a meeting place for the plan to overthrow Man Thanh.\n\nLater, in 1982, the temple was taken over by Venerable Thich Vinh Khuong and officially belonged to the Vietnam Buddhist Church. In 1984, the electricity was renamed Phuoc Hai Tu.\n\nAfter a long time, Ngoc Hoang Mai Thi Luu Pagoda has now become a famous tourist destination near the Saigon River. City people and tourists have always known the temple with its sacredness, praying for children, praying for luck and praying for peace.\n\n(Original)\nCHÙA LINH THIÊNG!\n1. Địa chỉ chùa Ngọc Hoàng ở đâu?\n\nChùa Ngọc Hoàng, hay còn gọi là Điện Ngọc Hoàng (Phước Hải Tự) tọa lạc tại số 73, đường Mai Thị Lựu, Quận 1, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh. Đây là ngôi chùa cổ quen thuộc với người dân Sài Gòn và khách du lịch với vẻ đẹp thu hút, chốn cầu con, cầu duyên linh thiêng.\n\nDù cách biệt với trung tâm thành phố nhưng đường di chuyển đến chùa tương đối dễ dàng. Tuy nhiên, khi lên kế hoạch tham quan, bạn cũng cần quan tâm đến vấn đề chùa Ngọc Hoàng mở cửa đến mấy giờ? Chùa mở cửa mỗi ngày nên bạn có thể đến tham quan, cầu phúc bất cứ lúc nào từ 7h đến 18h, riêng mùng 1 và rằm là từ 5h đến 19h.\n\n2. Lịch sử chùa Ngọc Hoàng Sài Gòn\n\nChùa Ngọc Hoàng ở Sài Gòn được xây dựng vào đầu thế kỷ XX, bởi một người Trung Quốc tên là Lưu Minh, tự Lưu Đạo Nguyên. Ban đầu, đây là ngôi điện thờ Ngọc Hoàng Thượng đế, đồng thời được Lưu Minh dùng làm nơi họp kín kế hoạch lật đổ Mãn Thanh.\n\nSau này, vào năm 1982, ngôi chùa được tiếp quản bởi hòa thượng Thích Vĩnh Khương và chính thức thuộc về Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam. Đến năm 1984 thì điện được đổi tên thành Phước Hải Tự.\n\nSau khoảng thời gian dài, chùa Ngọc Hoàng Mai Thị Lựu hiện nay đã trở thành một địa điểm du lịch nổi tiếng gần sông Sài Gòn. Người dân thành phố và khách du lịch vẫn luôn biết đến ngôi chùa với sự linh thiêng, cầu con, cầu duyên và cầu bình an.",

In addition to its spiritual element, this pagoda also possesses the beauty of ancient Chinese architecture.\n\nPainted in pink, many locals as well as tourists were there. No camera is allow when stepping into the temple,  hence no photo could be shown. These were taken outside of the temple.\n\nWe stay for about 20 minutes and left for next location.\n\nThe temple is free to visit, but a number of donation boxes are dotted around the sight. There is no strict dress code, but, to be respectful, opt for clothing that covers the shoulders and drops below the knee.\n\nRecommend taking a motorbike or taxi ride to Jade Emperor Pagoda because it is located in Binh Thanh District, which is quite far away from the city center.",

I expected something more beautiful.\n\nThree really lovely wood woodcarved panels in one the side rooms & very good woodwork in the other rooms, but there are far nicer temples in Saigon/Vietnam. If you are in the area and have time, pop in, but don't go out of your way to see it.\n\nPhotography is strictly prohibited inside the temple, and this is enforced.",

                                   "Chùa Ngọc Hoàng, also known as the Jade Emperor Pagoda, is a Taoist temple located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It was built in the early 20th century by a man named Lưu Minh, also known as Lưu Đạo Nguyên, a Quảng Đông native from China. The temple is dedicated to the Jade Emperor, the supreme deity in the Taoist pantheon .\nThe temple is one of the largest, most beautiful, and revered spiritual places in Ho Chi Minh City. It is filled with mythical statues and is over 100 years . Visiting Ngọc Hoàng Pagoda allows you to witness its stunning architecture, participate in spiritual activities, and have the opportunity to pray for peace and luck in life, especially in matters of child and love.\nThe temple is open for visitors from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM. To reach the temple, you can use various transportation options such as bus, motorbike, car, taxi, or ride-sharing services like Grab.\nWe too offered our prayer in the temple. It was a great experience as we visited the temple for the first time. It was very peaceful 😍.",

That's why it touched me so deeply 🥺 I spent more than 2-2,5 hours visiting, feeling  in this museum 🤍 The 3rd floor gives me very strong emotions, I am still under its influence. I was crying while listening what they did in the war. Getting to know Vietnamese heroines through the struggles of the American war and the French colony gave me goosebumps. Sending secret messages with scarves, women who joined the front at the age of 14-16, female soldiers, doctors, nurses who were ambushed and killed.. In Vietnam, women are very dominant in fashion, family structure and beliefs. An amazing museum. If you want to feel and really understand, you should get an audio guide.",

To anyone of mildly feminist sensibilities, this might seem like a questionable choice of topics. To be fair however, the 'Family' section is entirely (!) about planting and harvesting rice. 'Women in History' covers the period 1933-1975 and is nearly exclusively about women fighting and killing Americans. To be fair, there is a small section titled \"Destiny of Today's Women\" which mentions jobs available to women and a number of very capitalist success stories of female entrepreneurs.

They also show important women who contributed to Vietnam.\n\nTickets are priced at VND40,000 per person. They also provide recorded audio explanation at VND40,000. Do note that they only accept cash payment.\n\nSo note the their last entry to the museum seems to be around 7pm.",
